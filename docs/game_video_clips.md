### NSO Video Example #1

??? video "Calm Precision and Attention to Details During Intense Game Situations :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈1:44:42 mark in this video, while serving as a JT, a TTO is about to end before the game's final jam (18).
        - The game is closely contested, decided by each team's final scoring trip after a full two-minute jam.
        - I calmly performed the following actions:
            - Ended the TTO after exactly 60 seconds.
            - Quickly performed my pre-jam checks before immediately starting the jam.
            - Discretely approached the HR (≈1:45:43 mark) to advise them that:
                - The period clock expired.
                - The jam will last for two minutes since the Lead Jammer lost lead.  
            - Observed the team benches throughout the remainder of the jam for indications that either team intended to request an OR.
            - Used a verbal cue to advise the HR when there were ten seconds remaining in the jam (≈1:46:49 mark).
            - Performed the jam-ending call-off procedure with each of the following happening at the exact same time (≈1:46:59 mark):
                - The first tap of my hips.
                - The fourth blast from my whistle.
                - The jam clock reaching 0:00.
            - Observed the SBO add the final points to determine if an overtime jam was necessary (it was not).
            - Returned to a position adjacent to the Pivot Line while monitoring my stopwatch to ensure thirty seconds elapsed before the game result could become final.
            - After they became available, I advised the HR that it had been over thirty seconds since the jam ended and that I could indicate the game was final whenever they were ready (≈1:47:30 mark).
            - Waited for the HR's indication that the game should become final before immediately blowing my whistle to signal the final outcome (≈1:47:37 mark).

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - A close, intense game ended normally.
        - The HR had essential game and jam clock information throughout the jam without taking their eyes off the on-track action.
        - Neither team requested an OR to contest any timing.
        - The game outcome became final after the required wait period and after receiving instructions from the HR.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - Although the outcomes for this situation may seem underwhelming, I believe this is an example of how a JT can be somewhat of a safety net for their HR throughout a game, helping ensure it runs as smoothly as possible.
        - I want my HRs to know they trust me to calmly and precisely manage game timing procedures no matter how intense game action may be.
        - For me, performing JT responsibilities with precision throughout a game takes deliberate study and practice, and my ongoing preparation helped me contribute to a smooth ending in a close game.
            - The precision of my signal to the end of the TTO ensured that neither team gained an advantage by having additional time to rest, strategize, etc.
            The precision of my call-off timing ensured that neither team could score additional points after the jam clock expired.
            - I was prepared to help facilitate the correct end-of-regulation OR and OT procedures.

### NSO Video Example #2

??? video "Preparedness for Timely Responses to Team and Officiating Needs :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈25:58 mark in this video, while serving as a JT, the Lead Jammer (Red) will request that their JR call off the jam.
        - The jam is called off, and the Green "A" requests a TTO from their bench area.
        - I immediately respond to the TTO request, signal the TTO, communicate the appropriate information to the SBO, and position myself at the Pivot Line to perform standard TTO duties for the JT.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - The SBO stopped the official clock, and the TTO took place normally.
        - I ended the TTO exactly at 1:00 and monitored officials, players, team benches, and on-track players for readiness to start the next jam (≈27:02 mark).
        - As the lineup time approached 25 seconds, it did not appear the skating officials were ready for the next jam to start.
        - I determined the best course of action was to transition to an OTO rather than give verbal and visual cues to indicate the jam was about to start (≈27:27 mark).

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - While serving as JT, I focus on maintaining situational awareness, and I avoid the temptation to become distracted by gameplay.
        - During an active jam, I primarily focus my attention on the team bench areas and the scoreboard, and doing so allows me to:
            - Monitor the scoreboard for proper operation so I can respond immediately if there is a technical problem with CRG.
            - Monitor team benches for indications they may request a TTO or OTO when a jam ends.
        - My attentiveness to the team bench areas allowed me to immediately respond to Green's TTO request when the jam ended, ensuring the game clock did not continue to run when a team requested a stoppage.
        - My attentiveness to the officiating crew during the TTO:
            - Prevented the unnecessary confusion of issuing the "five seconds" verbal and visual cues followed by an immediate OTO.
            - Assured my officiating peers that I have their backs because I'm paying attention to the big picture view of the game so they can focus on their individual role responsibilities.

### NSO Video Example #3

??? video "Active Monitoring and Responsiveness to Game Actions and Risk Management Compliance :material-cursor-default-click:"

    - This example is several short videos that demonstrate the importance I place on situational awareness and responsiveness to time-sensitive actions while serving as JT.
    - Some of these examples may seem ordinary, although I believe repeatably performing ordinary tasks with precision helps support:
        - Competitive gameplay.
        - Smooth game flow.
        - Officiating crew confidence.

    === "Video #1 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈38:27 mark in this video, the lineup clock reaches 20 seconds, and I start to shift my primary attention from the team benches, monitoring for TO and OR requests, to the steps I take to start the next jam:

                1. I check the penalty box to attempt to identify the Jammers for the upcoming jam.
                2. I look toward the PBM for any indications they may need an OTO.
                3. I check the medical bench area to confirm at least one person on the medical staff is able to observe game action on the track.
                4. I check the track area to attempt to identify the Jammers for the upcoming jam.
                5. I look toward the HR for any indications they may need an OTO.
                6. I look toward the SBO and SKs for any indications they may need an OTO.

            - I am aware that this game only has one person on its medical staff, and I observe that they have their attention on an athlete in the medical bench area.                

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - When the lineup clock reaches 25 seconds, I initiate an OTO and indicate to the HR that the medical staff is not able to observe game action.
            - The HR confers with the medical staff, and, after ≈25 seconds, the HR indicates to me that medical staff are available to observe game action.
            - I immediately end the OTO and prepare to start the next jam.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - In the JT role, I have a macro point-of-view of the game and game area that allows me to monitor for potential safety issues and stop the game clock when necessary.
            - I conduct a safety check before each jam to help ensure the game remains compliant with risk management and insurance guidelines.

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈1:17:52 mark in this video, the jam is about to end.
            - As soon as the jam ends, the Green team "A" requests a TTO.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I signal the TTO and simultaneously stop the game clock the moment the jam-ending whistles conclude.
            - The TTO started immediately, without requiring the "A" or "C" to seek the attention of an official.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - My immediate responsiveness to the TTO request ensured the game clock stopped without delay, supporting whatever the Green team's clock management strategy may have been.
            - I position myself during a jam to respond to timeout requests at any moment, and I believe that preparedness and immediate responsiveness helps build trust between officiating crews and teams.

            **This video demonstrates the same scenario as the previous video in a different game**

            - At the ≈30:00 mark in this video, the jam is about to end.
            - As soon as the jam ends, the Black team "A" requests a TTO.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I signal the TTO and simultaneously stop the game clock the moment the jam-ending whistles conclude.
            - The TTO started immediately, without requiring the "A" or "C" to seek the attention of an official.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - My immediate responsiveness to the TTO request ensured the game clock stopped without delay, supporting whatever the Green team's clock management strategy may have been.
            - I position myself during a jam to respond to timeout requests at any moment, and I believe that preparedness and immediate responsiveness helps build trust between officiating crews and teams.

            - At the ≈1:32:42 mark in this video, the jam clock is about to expire.
            - I advise the HR that there are 10 seconds remaining in the jam.
            - I call off the jam when it expires.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - The jam ended naturally and the game transitioned into lineups.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - I performed the jam-ending call-off procedure by aligning the first tap of my hips, the fourth blast from my whistle, and the jam clock reaching 0:00.
            - The precision of this jam-ending call-off is not an accident; I regularly practice this timing so I can be as accurate as possible during game action.
            - A precise call-off ensures that time-sensitive actions within a game (penalty box timing, points scoring, etc.) are accurate and fair.

            - At the ≈45:55 mark in this video, I am about to end a brief OTO I initiated to ensure the medical staff was available to monitor game action.
            - After I end the OTO, I give the verbal and visual cues to indicate I will start the next jam in 5 seconds.
            - As I conduct my pre-jam-start check, I observe SBO give me an indication that they need an OTO.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I immediately started a new OTO, and, after a few seconds, the SBO indicated they were ready for the next jam to start.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - I am diligent about performing pre-jam-start checks before every jam so I don't inadvertently start a jam when doing so may be problematic.

### SO Video Example #1

??? video "Positioning, Attention to Details, and Thorough Game Information Communication :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈20:22 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe White #25 cut one of their teammates, White #314, 
        - White #314 is in front of White #25 and skates in non-derby direction to create a bridge between the front and rear pack walls while White #25 is OOB.
        - White #25 returns to a fully upright and in-bounds position after White #314 is behind White #25.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I am in the correct position to monitor each player's relative position precisely throughout the action.
        - I use an official hand signal ("no earned pass") to indicate I am aware of and will not penalize White #25 for the action.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - Even though this detail ended up being inconsequential to gameplay, I am proactive and deliberate in my awareness of player positioning.
        - I slowly and clearly communicate my observations with a visual cue to improve the flow of potentially impactful game information.

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈1:11:44 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe White #30 legally block my Jammer, Purple #88, OOB.
        - As Purple #88 skates in non-derby direction while OOB, I keep track of White #30 who has superior position on Purple #88.
        - White #30 skates in non-derby direction while remaining in bounds until Purple #76 initiates a legal block that forces White #30 to place a toe stop OOB.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - Although White #30 is in front of Purple #76, I am aware that Purple #76 now has superior position over White #30.
        - White #30 returns to a fully-in-bounds position and, now having cut Purple #76, initiates a derby action without ceding their cut.
        - While remaining in a position to follow my Jammer, Purple #88, I issue a cut penalty to White #30.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"
        - I believe this sort of cut scenario is somewhat less common than conventional cuts, and my understanding of derby rules combined with extensive practice maintaining situational awareness of the action within my area of responsibility allowed me to make what I believe is the correct call.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - While this is hardly ideal, I recognize I will make mistakes, and it is important to me to immediately and specifically apologize as a mechanism to acknowledge my errors and attempt to build trust with players, coaches, and my peers.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"
        - I want to show the people I serve that I care deeply about getting things right, and that I will not use/abuse the power afforded to me as an official as a platform to insist I am correct.

    - TBD

    === "Video #1 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈11:19:07 mark of this video, while serving as rear OPR, I issue a direction penalty to Red #701 for a block in non-derby direction that causes Black #271 to go out of bounds
            - Approximately 1/3 of my game history is NSO roles, and, when I am in SO roles, I pay close attention to the actions I can take as an SO to make sure NSOs easily get the information they need.
            - I frequently and specifically practice issuing penalties with slow, clear, and deliberate hand signals while continuously moving and changing direction to mimic game situations like this.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - You will see that I slowly use the hand signal to indicate a direction penalty followed by a swoop and repeat both the penalty and swoop hand signals, all while remaining in my assigned area of responsibility (on the rear wall).

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - When I use clear and identifiable verbal and visual cues, my peer NSOs can do their jobs with less strain, promoting a better game experience for everyone.
            - Remaining in position while I issue penalties is essential to ensure I effectively officiate within my zone and allows my peer officials to remain focused on their zones.

    === "Video #2 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈27:41 mark of this video, while serving as rear OPR, I observe Purple #07 initiate forceful contact to the head of White #215, and decide to penalize Purple #07 for a high block.
            - I deliberately use a slow and clear and visual cue to ensure my peer officials are aware of the penalized action.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - In the course of issuing the penalty to Purple #07, several blockers skate in non-derby direction.  I make a rapid movement to accelerate laterally in non-derby direction before coming to a sharp stop in alignment with the blockers reforming the rear wall.
            - Even though I had to maneuver my body rapidly, I completed the motion of the high block verbal cue while maneuvering myself.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - I believe this video demonstrates I have the skating skills, game awareness, and specific practice in the OPR role to successfully perform several actions at once, which improves my ability to effectively officiate and support my peers.

        - At the ≈22:42 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe my Jammer, White #408, who does not have Lead Jammer status, initiate and successfully complete an apex jump during a call-off by Purple Jammer #46.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - I was able to be in a position to observe my Jammer initiate the apex jump while fully in-bounds, and land one skate in bounds in front of three opposing blockers before the end of the fourth jam-ending whistle.
        - I immediately signaled the three earned points, before the third set of jam-ending whistles.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I believe this situation demonstrates I have the capacity to process a lot of information simultaneously, be in the precise position to observe the location of Jammer and blocker hips at the exact moment the jam ends, and observe the exact position of the Jammer’s feet before they leave the track and as they land.
        - Whenever possible, it’s important to me to signal points immediately when a jam ends as a mechanism to:
            - Show players and coaches that I have confidence the points I’m reporting are accurate.
            - Afford the SKs and SBO maximum time to perform their responsibilities during lineups.

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈4:14:45 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe Black #63 move slightly in non-derby direction to initiate a block on my Jammer, White #916, that causes my Jammer to fall.
        - I blew my whistle to issue a direction penalty to Black #63, although I made the assessment that the contact was not the reason White #916 fell.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - I determined White #916 fell because they slipped on a metal maintenance cover built into the concrete track, and used my discretion and judgment to not issue a penalty to Black #63.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - While this decision may seem trivial, this game was closely contested and I felt the doubt I had about whether or not the contact initiated by Black #63 was sufficient to justify a penalty necessitated a no-call.
        - I make every effort to keep skaters on the track and in competition unless I am 100% certain an action or actions meet the criteria to warrant a penalty.
        - After reviewing the video later in the day, I believe I made the correct call.

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈1:00:35 mark in this video, while serving as a JR and my Jammer, White #33, standing in the penalty box, I raise my right hand and finger to indicate who I believe the foremost pack skater is, so I can assess the position of the front engagement zone and be sure that White #33 legally reenters the track after they are released from the penalty box.
        - I continued to monitor the foremost pack skater’s location until White #33 left the penalty box and reentered the track, which occurs at the ≈1:00:43 mark in this video.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - Although White #33’s reentry point is not visible in the video, I carefully monitored the position of the front engagement zone and determined that White #33 entered approximately 18.5’ in front of White #1975 (before White #1975 left the pack and enters the front engagement zone themselves).
        - I waited for White #33 to make a derby move, and they continued to skate forward instead of ceding the illegal reentry, so assessed an illegal reentry penalty to White #33.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - This is an example of the attention to detail I pay in order to ensure gameplay is safe and fair.

        - I observed Black #77 use their hand to brace themselves on my Jammer, White #18, during their apex jump, and successfully gain position on White #18 and White #417.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - While maintaining position to follow my Jammer, I issued a forearm penalty to Black #77 with the additional verbal cue, “*bracing on an opponent*.”

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I believe this example shows I have the capacity to assess the game impact of illegal actions quickly and appropriately penalize athletes who gain an advantage using, in this case, an illegal blocking zone, even in ways that may not seem obvious.

        - At the ≈10:23:44 mark in this video, while serving as rear OPR, I observe Black #211 initiate a block that sends Red Jammer OOB.
        - I also observe that Black Pivot gains superior position over Red Jammer just before Red Jammer is blocked out of bounds.
        - Red Jammer re-enters the track behind Black #211, and I follow Black Pivot as they skate in non-derby direction.
        - Red Jammer re-enters the track in front of Black Pivot, cutting Black Pivot, and fails to cede the cut.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - Although I do not issue the penalty (indicated by my not using a swoop hand signal) since some of the action occurred outside my zone of responsibility, I blow my whistle and signal to the IPRs and JR that I have sufficient information to issue a cut penalty to Red Jammer for illegally gaining position on Black Pivot.
        - Red Jammer’s JR issues the cut penalty.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I believe this video shows I am capable of tracking and communicating player positioning in a situation where player movement is fast, pack movement is dynamic, and officials need to communicate individual pieces of information amongst each other to make sure we, as a crew, neither issue penalties where they aren’t warranted, nor fail to issue penalties when they are warranted.

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - This video clip is an entire half of a derby game from Y’Allstars 2024, where I served as a JR for Beast Side Roller Derby.
        - Beast Side fielded extremely talented and fast Jammers who presented many challenges to effectively officiate.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - While imperfect, I believe I did a good job maintaining position at the hips of my Jammers, accurately tracking points, signaling Lead Jammer status accurately, and calling off jams precisely.
        - Anecdotally, the track surface was highly abrasive concrete, causing many officials and athletes to grind toe stops down to their posts and, of course, requiring replacements.
        - I adapted to the track conditions by almost entirely using hockey stops and power slides, avoiding the use of toe stops as much as possible, and ensuring I would not experience an equipment failure during gameplay.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I believe my ability to almost entirely use wheel-based stops with fast-moving Jammers shows that I have the skating skill capacity to adapt to various track conditions and remain an effective official.

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈57:45 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, my Jammer, White #700 will earn lead, rapidly exit the front engagement zone, and approach the rear of the pack at high speed.
        - My Jammer realizes they do not have much time before the opposing Jammer will approach the pack and score points for themselves.
        - My Jammer rapidly decelerates and negotiates the pack for a few seconds before calling-off the jam.
        - The players in this game are all RCR TT skaters, making the game representative of elite-level play.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I had to rapidly accelerate to maintain alignment with my Jammer on their scoring trip, respond to and match their rapid deceleration in a compressed space (the middle of a turn), maintain accurate alignment with my Jammer to track earned passes, and respond to the jam call-off request immediately.
        - I used a single-leg backward plow stop technique to perform a controlled stop that allowed me to remain in position, not occupy more space than absolutely necessary, and move laterally through the apex of the turn in alignment with my Jammer.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I specifically practice this exact stop technique and scenario because it is difficult to get right, and I believe this example demonstrates I exhibit the skating skills and body positioning required to officiate fast-moving derby with elite-level players and teams.

        - At the beginning of this video, while serving as the ALTR, I am standing between the Deus and bleachers while observing the game and taking notes.
        - Jam 7 of the 2nd period ends, and, off-camera, the rear OPR approaches me to indicate they need temporary relief from the game.
        - Just before jam 8 starts, I position myself near the Jammer Line to serve as the rear OPR.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - The game continued without a clock stoppage or gap in officiating coverage.
        - I was able to sit, remove my helmet and the black NSO top that covered my referee stripes, replace my helmet, and position myself to substitute for the rear OPR before jam 8 started.
        - I substituted for seven jams before the rear OPR was ready to resume their position.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - My readiness helped my crew keep the game flowing and on schedule, avoiding a gap in officiating coverage or potential delay of several minutes while I geared up and warmed up.
        - It's not ordinary for an ALTR to activate without stopping the game clock, and I am proud that my state of preparedness supported contiguous gameplay.
        - In the ALTR role, I keep myself ready to enter the game at any moment of need, and I had warmed up before the game and again at intermission, so my body was prepared for physical activity.
        - Although I expected to serve in the ALTR role throughout the game, I kept engaged with the game action for the event that I would need to activate.
        - This video demonstrates the importance I place on the ALTR role, how I do whatever I can to support optimal game/event flow, and the level of readiness and engagement I maintain throughout a game while serving in the ALTR role.

        - Having sufficient information to determine the contact initiation and resulting game impact meet the criteria to issue a penalty, I issue a forearm penalty to green #51.
        - The jam ends a few seconds later, and the Green "A" approaches me to express that they believe the action did not have sufficient impact to warrant a penalty.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - Although I felt comfortable with my decision to issue the penalty, I did not argue my case to the Green "A" because I thought doing so would be counterproductive.
        - I patiently listened to the Green "A" express their disagreement/dissatisfaction and validated their argument by nodding and saying "okay" to acknowledge their feedback.
        - The Green "A" returned to their bench and the next jam started without incident.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - For me, this action is a key element to officiating effectively and building trust with players and coaches.
        - I believed the Green "A" wanted to express their opinion to me, not argue with me, and I feel confident that arguing would have escalated the situation.
        - I estimated that Green "A" needed to express frustration, and I want to earn their trust by listening to understand them, not listening to respond to or argue with them.

        - This video demonstrates the process I use each time I observe action that may warrant a penalty, in addition to assessing game impact, making a mental note of which players took which actions, etc.
        - Each time I observe action that may warrant a penalty, I try to find any rules-supported reason that will allow me to *not* penalize a player.
        - Although this strategy isn't perfect and sometimes results in me failing to issue a penalty that I should issue, I take the act of penalizing and removing a player from the track seriously, and I would rather mistakenly leave a player on the track than erroneously send them to the penalty box and potentially impact the competitive balance of a game.

        - From my point-of-view, it appeared that Purple #07 cut by returning to an upright and in-bounds position in front of White #39.
        - Purple #07 does not cede the apparent cut, and I am slightly behind a position that would allow me to accurately determine the exact position of White #39 and Purple #07.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - I do not issue a penalty to Purple #07 under the basis that I was not in position to determine if Purple #07 actually cuts White #39.
        - I use a no-earned-pass visual cue to indicate to my peers that I cannot issue a cut penalty based on the information I have.
        - When I review the video, it is clear to me that I missed a legitimate cut because I was too far behind the action.
        - While I would love to be in the best possible position to observe the most relevant game action at all times, this is a case where I did not anticipate gameplay sufficiently and ended up about .5 seconds late getting to where I needed to be to observe Purple #07 cut White #39.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - Although I'm disappointed in myself for the mistake, I recognize I will make mistakes in every game, and I want to do the best I can to avoid worsening a situation.
        - This video demonstrates I am not going to guess at whether or not I should issue a penalty; I either have the information I need, or I don't.
        - Had I been asked about the situation by a player or coach, or had their been an OR, I would have responded by stating, "I was not in position to accurately observe the action."
        - While that response is not ideal, I would rather fall on that sword than issue a penalty without the appropriate vantage point and have my CHR have to manage complaints or an OR that asserts I was not in position to issue a penalty I just issued.
        - Anecdotally, reviewing this game footage provided an opportunity to learn to better anticipate how to position myself in similar situations.

### SO Video Example #17

??? video "Positioning Precision, Hustle, & Peer Communication :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - The 1:15:44 mark of this video is the start of jam 17 in period 2.
        - This is a playoff game that determines which team will earn a position in the 2024 WFTDA Global Championship Tournament.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - I am the rear OPR, and although nothing extraordinary happens in this jam, I believe this jam is a good example oh how you can expect me to officiate for any level of play.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - You will observe me:
        
            1. Continuously adjusting my position to have as precise a point of view of relevant game action as possible.
            2. Using sharp movements to accelerate and decelerate, even in small spaces, to improve my positioning precision.
            3. Sprinting, even in small spaces, to be exactly where I need to be.
            4. Using lateral movement techniques like tracking, cross-pulls, and power slides that allow me to keep my body facing the pack, give me the widest possible angle to observe game action, and afford me the flexibility to quickly change direction and accelerate at any moment.
            5. Using non-standard visual cues, hand signals, and head movements to relay information to my peer officials.

        - At the ≈1:16:35 mark, one of the JRs issues a penalty to White #39, who appears to illegally exit the track.
        
            1. Understanding the severity of issuing a player a second penalty, especially in a playoff game, I point at the player to get the attention of my CHR so they can determine if they want to issue a second penalty (they do).

        - At the ≈1:16:46 mark, the front OPR issues a penalty to Purple #11 (blocker) that the front IPR repeats, in order to relay the call to the player.

            1. Purple #117 (Jammer) hears the repeated penalty call, and, apparently believing they have their own penalty, leaves the track to self-report to the penalty box.
            2. Suspecting #117 may not have a penalty, I immediately start pointing and verbally relaying my observation to my peer officials who return Purple #117 to the track with only minimal impact to gameplay.

### SO Video Example #18

??? video "Use of Skating Techniques Recover and Maintain Accurate Positioning :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈1:45:47 mark in this video, while serving as front IPR, the pack is about to transition from "all" to "front."
        - I am monitoring the pack movement and use a verbal and visual cue to inform players and officials that I temporarily assumed control of the primary pack definition responsibility from the rear IPR.
        - In the transition of the pack definition to my responsibility, Blue #26 accelerates forward more quickly than I anticipate while they chase Green Jammer forward.
        - I end up slightly out of the optimal position, with Blue #26 now in front of my position and the rest of the pack gaining speed. 

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I never want to be out of position, although this sort of situation is something I routinely practice and drill so I can get back into position immediately.
        - I sprint forward to catch Blue #26 just as they begin to reduce their speed, so I transition to a power slide technique that allows me to return to the appropriate position, observe the status of the players in my zone, and stay out of the path of the Blue Jammer's JR.
        - At the end of the power slide, as the JR and I approach turn 3, I use a two-stage pivot technique, shifting to my right and then back to my left to ensure I:

            1. Make sure the Blue JR has a clear path to remain in position with their Jammer.
            2. Quickly shift to a position along the inside boundary, looking back at the pack, that allows me to observe the rear IPR, the status of the pack, and player actions.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - These actions may seem unremarkable, although I want to point out they do not happen, at least for me, by accident.
        - These are the sorts of skating techniques I practice every week.  I frequently study game film to understand how I can move myself to improve my positioning, develop drills that help me build new skills, and repeat the drills until I perform the actions in a game without having to think about them.
        - I share this so you are aware of the sort effort and discipline you can expect from me during my preparation to be a member of any officiating crew.

??? video "Attention to Details to Avoid Issuing a Penalty :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈4:32 mark of this video, while serving as rear OPR, I observed Purple #48 initiate a block on White #42 with a legal blocking zone to a legal target zone.
        - Purple #48's block causes White #42 to fall on top of Purple #88 who is seemingly in a down position at the time of the contact.
        - I blow my whistle to issue a misconduct penalty to Purple #48 for blocking White #42 into a downed player (Purple #88).

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - Although I blew my whistle inadvertently, I observed that Purple #88 met the criteria for "upright" at the time White #42 makes contact with them (as a result of Purple #48's block).
        - I used a non-standard hand signal (hand waive) to indicate I have no penalty to issue/report.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - The way I positioned myself allowed me to observe specific details I needed to avoid issuing a penalty, even though the contact had the visual appearance of potentially warranting a penalty.
        - This video demonstrates the close attention I pay to the details of game actions and how the results of those actions should be interpreted by the WFTDA rules.

### SO Video Example #20

??? video "Proactively Monitoring Game Action :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the beginning of this video, while serving as front OPR, I monitored athletes exiting and entering the track area during lineups after jam #4.
            - Jam #4 ended while I was positioned near the center of turn #4, adjacent to the score table, team benches, and penalty box.
        - I observed White #12 occupy a position behind the Jammer Line while neither wearing nor holding a Jammer helmet cover.
        - I observed no Jammer for White in the penalty box area.
        - When the jam starts, I immediately call off the jam and advise my CHR that White did not field a Jammer for jam #5.
        - I use a standard visual cue to indicate I recommend assessing a penalty to the White team for delay of game.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - The HR immediately transitioned the stoppage to an OTO and issued White a delay of game penalty.
        - The Captain for White reported to the penalty box to serve the penalty and a white blocker left the track area.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - An area of emphasis for me is monitoring player and team actions at all times, including times the jam clock is not running.
        - Since gameplay happens even when there is no active jam, I do my best to proactively identify potential rules violations or safety issues.  That means, whenever possible, I monitor players during lineups to identify illegal or potentially illegal actions.
        - While it seemed likely White would not field a Jammer, I kept my body language and movements as neutral and natural as possible to avoid divulging my observations and potentially preventing Black from rightfully earning a competitive advantage.
        - Even though I was not in the official in the best position to make this particular call, I felt like I had enough information to take action and amplify the credibility of our crew.

### SO Video Example #21

??? video "Identifying and Tracking Complex Non-Initiator Cut Scenarios :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the beginning of this video, while serving as JR for Black Jammer #411, I observe Red blocker #508 force my Jammer OOB near the center of turn 1 on the outside of the track.
            - I observed the middle OPR point to indicate that Red #508 initiated the block that sent Black #411 OOB.
            - I note that all other Red blockers are in front of Black #411 when Red #508 blocks Black #411 OOB.
        - I observe Black #3 force Red #508 OOB near the entrance of turn 1 on the outside of the track, and I am aware that Red #508 has now lost and cannot regain their superior position advantage over Black #411.
        - I observe Red Pivot #3 skate in non-derby direction toward the rear engagement zone, and I mind the rear IPR's verbal cue that the pack is now "front."
        - I monitor Black #411 as they attend to an apparent malfunction of their left skate while observing all Red non-pivot blockers skate in non-derby direction.
        - Black #411 returns to an upright position and skates in non-derby direction while still OOB.
        - The rear IPR issues an OOP warning to Red #3 and Black #411 moves to return to an in-bounds position in front of Red #3.
        - Red #3 begins to skate forward, and I hear the rear OPR use a verbal cue to indicate Red #3 is back in play before I observe Black #411 return to a fully in-bounds position.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - After waiting a few moments to determine if Black #411 would take immediate action to return OOB and cede their position, I issued a cut penalty to Black #411 for illegally gaining position on Red Pivot #3.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - This sort of situation has some complexities and is often misunderstood by players and coaches who believe Black #411 may legally reenter the track in front of Red #3 because Red #3 went OOP.
        - My active awareness of player positioning and monitoring of superior position status allows me to recognize that:
            - Red #3, as a player who did not initiate the block that sent Black #411 OOB, briefly lost their superior position over Black #411 when they went OOP at the trailing edge of the rear engagement zone.
            - Red #3 reestablished their superior position over Black #411 after returning to the rear engagement zone.
            - Black #411 illegally gained position on Red #3 using the OOB area (cut) and did not take immediate action to cede the cut.
        - The rear IPR communicates with me to confirm that I am aware that Red #3 went OOP, and I respond by indicating that Red #3 is a "non-initiator" who reestablished their superior position before Black #411 returned to an in-bounds position.
        - I believe this video demonstrates the following:
            - My detailed attentiveness to tracking player positioning at all times so I can determine if a player illegally gains position using the OOB area.
            - My understanding of roller derby rules regarding gaining, losing, and reestablishing superior positioning for OOB block initiators and non-initiators alike.
            - My confidence to assess a penalty that I am nearly certain will draw enthusiastic objection from the player, their captain, their peers, and their coaches.

??? video "Contact Initiation and Game Impact Assessment :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈37:08 mark of this video, while serving as front IPR, I observed Green #11 and Blue jammer, #37, make contact with their lower legs.
        - The contact causes Green #11 to immediately fall and Blue Jammer falls about a second afterward.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - I determined that Green #11 used an illegal blocking zone to initiate contact with an illegal target zone on Blue Jammer, which caused Blue Jammer to adopt a downed position.
        - I issued a low block penalty to Green #11 and directed them to report to the penalty box with the appropriate whistle signal plus verbal and visual cues.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - Making the correct calls or no-calls can be difficult, especially when a lot happens at once or at high speed and I never want to mistakenly penalize a player for contact they should not be penalized for, no matter how the contact appears to the untrained eye.
            - Correctly assessing contact initiation and identifying appropriate game impact before I issue a penalty is essential to me, and I believe my actions resulted in the correct outcome for this situation.
            - I diligently work to observe player movement continuously during game action so I can correctly identify the initiator(s) of contact and whether or not the contact is legal.
        - In this case, although both players were moving toward each other at the time of the contact which caused both players to fall, I believe I correctly assessed that Blue Jammer had an established skating trajectory and Green #11 initiated the illegal low contact.
        - Instead of immediately blowing my whistle after I observed the illegal low contact, I intentionally waited and continued to observe Blue Jammer for indications of game impact that resulted from the contact.
            - As soon as I observed Blue Jammer fall, I have the information I need to issue a penalty (initiation and impact) and explain it in detail if necessary.
        - I intentionally spend almost twelve seconds issuing the appropriate verbal and visual cues while continuously skating and observing my assigned zone so my peer officials and any interested observers can clearly identify the penalty and the official responsible for issuing the penalty.

    - This example is several short videos from a single JRDA L3 regulation game where I serve as the front IPR.
    - The game had been mostly straightforward to officiate for the first ≈40 minutes of game clock time, although a few factors may have contributed to a significant increase in the officiating workload over the final ≈20 minutes:
        - This was the first game of an HT season for each team after their off-season.
        - Many of the players were playing in their first-ever game.
        - It was a hot, late-summer day, and the venue was particularly warm.
        - The athletes may have been tiring from intense, physical play.
    - I work hard to keep my body and mind in peak condition so I can function effectively, calmly, and accurately in challenging conditions and game situations knowing that my ability to officiate professionally and with composure regardless of the conditions can help deescalate tense situations and prevent difficult situations from escalating.
    - These videos highlight my:
        - Physical conditioning and ability to perform with precision in high and extreme-heat situations.
        - Mental preparation to remain focused and attentive to the important details that happen during game action.
        - Intense weekly practice to remain sharp and continuously improve and refine both my skating and officiating skills.

            - While monitoring pack definition, I observed Blue #018 initiate legal contact with Green #33 which caused Green #33 to step OOB while in front of Blue #018.
            - Green #33 returns to a fully upright and in-bounds position in front of Blue #018.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I issue a cut penalty to Green #33 for illegally gaining position on Blue #018 using the OOB area.

            - I demonstrate that I can calmly manage all of the following simultaneously:
                - Continuously monitoring gameplay for the presence of a pack.
                - Remain aware of which players have and earn superior position over other players.
                - Track the relative positions of Green #33 and Blue #018 before and after contact.
                - Assess the transition of the pack from "front" to "all" to determine where to position myself.
                - Observe Green #33's trajectory as they exit the track.
                - Determine that game conditions allow me to briefly leave my position so I can approach the PLT for Green to ensure they are aware of the second penalty.
                - Slowly, deliberately, and clearly deliver the appropriate verbal and visual cues for the penalties I issued.
                - Relay a direction penalty from the rear OPR to the PLTs.

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈1:24:58 mark in this video, a no-pack situation occurs, and I have to quickly co-determine with my peer IPR/HR whether the destruction of the pack was natural and legal or unnatural and illegal.
            - Just after the no-pack occurs, an OOP block with sufficient game impact to warrant a penalty occurs in the coverage zone of the rear IPR/HR that they need to attend to, and I am not immediately able to determine their perspective regarding the pack destruction.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I determined Blue #555 illegally destroyed the pack by accelerating in the counterclockwise direction at a pace that deviated from the established pack speed.
            - I assessed an illegal position penalty to Blue #555 for unnatural pack destruction.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - A lot happens within a few seconds, and I take quick, decisive, and accurate actions:
                - I visualize the "lasagna slice" shape of the distance between Blue #555 (near the inside boundary) and the nearest Green blocker (in the middle of the track) and assess Blue #555's trajectory (toward the middle of the track) and acceleration relative to the speed of the rest of the pack.
                - As I monitor Blue #555 destroy the pack, I turn my head slightly to the right to determine the foremost Green blocker's speed and trajectory and understand if they might be responsible for the pack destruction (legally or illegally) while concurrently issuing a "no-pack" warning.
                - I determined that Blue #555 illegally destroyed the pack, and I made a mental note to not include them in the process of redefining the pack.
                - I quickly look to my right and left to account for all blockers, observe blocker movement, determine if blockers are taking the appropriate actions to reform the pack, and continue monitoring the distance between blockers from both teams.
                - I issue a second "no-pack" warning, check the distance between blockers from both teams (excluding Blue #555, who I know to be a penalized player), and issue the verbal cue "pack is here" as the pack reforms.
                - I immediately assess the pack destruction penalty to Blue #555 just as the jam ends.
            - I practice extensively to have the capacity to manage these sorts of situations with speed and precision.  Specifically, and that includes:
                - Practicing pack definition for several hours each week with varying levels of skill and competitiveness.
                - I obsessively study game video of my own pack definition and that of other officials to learn how I can improve.
                - I augment my game video study by mocking up various in-game pack scenarios with [Track-Viz :octicons-link-external-24:](https://trackviz.netlify.app "Track-Viz Roller Derby Pack Simulation Tool"){ target=_blank } to help me better visualize pack geometry and improve the speed and precision at which I can monitor and process pack dynamics.

    === "Video #3 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈1:25:38 mark in this video, while serving as front IPR, a sustained no-pack situation occurs.
            - Players from both teams do not immediately take appropriate actions to reform the pack, and several players commit actions that have sufficient impact to warrant penalties.
            - It is not clear to the JRs whether Lead Jammer status is available or lost.
            - It is my responsibility to:
                - Issue "no-pack" warnings until the pack reforms.
                - Identify and track any players who commit penalties within my coverage zone (the front wall, in this case).
                - Use clear verbal and visual cues to indicate when the pack reforms.
                - Clearly communicate penalty assessment to my on- and off-skates peer officials so they have the information they need to do their jobs.
                - Ensure the JRs understand the availability of Lead Jammer status.
                - Remain in position to continue observing game action.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - Before the pack reforms, I determine that:
                - Blue Jammer (#277) initiates OOP contact with Green #616, which causes Green #616 to adopt a downed position.
                - Green #03 is the blocker most responsible for reforming the pack and fails to take the required action(s) to do so.
            - When the pack reforms, I issue the verbal cue "pack is here" and immediately start the process to assess the appropriate penalties.
                - The JR for Blue doesn't have a way of knowing that I intend to assess a penalty to Blue Jammer, and they begin to use the whistle signal and visual cue to issue Lead Jammer status.
                - I am already moving into position to issue an illegal contact penalty to Blue Jammer (for an OOP block with game impact) to help reduce confusion about Lead Jammer status availability.
                - As soon as I issue the penalty to Blue Jammer, I make a rapid direction change to return to my position and immediately issue an illegal position penalty to Green #03 for failure to reform the pack.
            - I observe my peer IPR penalize Blue #21 and I identify that there are only three blockers on the track.
                - I determine that the current pack formation does not require the attention of two IPRs, and, while keeping my body facing the pack, I skate toward the PLTs to ensure they have all of the information they need to track the surge of penalties.
            - I return to my position at the front of the pack after communicating with the PLTs for ≈5 seconds and observe the Green Jammer establish superior position over all blockers, although the JR does not immediately indicate Lead Jammer status.
                - The JR for Green turns their head toward me to ask if Lead Jammer status is open.
                - I reach my right hand to my left hand to feel for an assistive device that I habitually use to track Lead Jammer availability.
                - I feel the position of the assistive device and determine that Lead Jammer status is open, so I turn my head toward the JR for Green and say, "Open, open, open."
                - The Green JR immediately issues Lead Jammer status.        

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - I believe the front IPR position is more challenging than it may appear to the untrained eye.  In my opinion, a well-practiced IPR excels at:
                - "Owning" their own coverage zone while providing supporting coverage and communication to their peer SOs and NSOs.
                - Rapid task switching between pack definition, contact initiation assessment, player position changes, lead jammer status, etc.
                - Rapid backward acceleration, backward skating at high speed, immediate stops and direction changes, continuously positioning themselves to observe the most relevant game action, and ensuring that JRs have unobstructed lanes.
                - Understanding track geometry through its turns and how it impacts the distance between players and the shape of the engagement zone.
            - I extensively study and practice the front IPR position to embody these traits so I can manage complex situations like this one while supporting and advising my peer officials.

    === "Video #4 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈1:28:05 mark in this video, while serving as front IPR, Green #616 attempts to create a bridge between the front and rear blocker walls.
            - A series of events happen nearly simultaneously, which causes Green #616 to illegally destroy the pack:

                1. All on-track blockers are part of an established pack with clearly defined front and rear walls as Green #616 leaves the penalty box, legally enters the track, and skates in derby direction until they reach the front wall.

                    - This action and natural gameplay move the pack from "all" to "front."

                2. At the rear wall, Blue #21 initiates a block that sends the Green Jammer OOB and skates in non-derby direction to recycle the Green Jammer.

                    - Blue #21 skates more than 10 feet from the nearest blocker.
                    - Blue #21 continues skating in non-derby direction until they reach the edge of the rear engagement zone and receive an OOP warning from the rear IPR.
                    - Blue #21 responds to the OOP warning by skating in derby direction and returning to the rear engagement zone.

                3. At the front wall, Green #616 comes to a stop and begins skating in non-derby direction as Blue #21 returns to a position within 10 feet of the rear wall.

                    - The rear wall is still within the rear engagement zone and not part of the pack.

                4. Green #616 continues skating in non-derby direction until they are more than 10 feet from the front wall's rearmost blocker and within 10 feet of the foremost blocker in the rear wall.

                    - This action created two equally sized groups of blockers from both teams that were more than 10 feet apart, commonly referred to as a "no-pack, split."

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - Green #616 illegally destroyed the pack.
            - Even though I've yet to issue a penalty to Green #616, as a penalized skater, they are no longer part of pack definition, so the pack immediately reforms at the front wall.
            - I use the following verbal and visual cues sequentially and without delay:
                - "No-pack, split."
                - "Pack is here."
                - 1 x long whistle blast.
                - "Green #616, destruction."

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - Getting this right and in sync with the rear IPR takes a lot of practice and requires that I concurrently and precisely:
                - Measure the distance between the rearmost pack skater and Green #616.
                - Monitor Green #616's proximity to the foremost blocker in the rear wall.
                - Monitor Blue #21’s proximity to the rearmost blocker in the rear wall as Blue #21 returns to the rear engagement zone.
                - Identify whether Green #616 is skating in non-derby direction, stopped, or skating in derby direction at the exact moment the no-pack split occurs.
                - Align my measurements and timing with the rear IPR.
                - Identify and signal the pack’s destruction and immediate reformation with the appropriate verbal and visual cues.
                - Penalize Green #616 for illegally destroying the pack.
            - As my peers evaluate me, I want them to see that:
                - I am capable of correctly processing and handling complex pack dynamics in real-time, and they can trust me to support them similarly when they include me on their officiating rosters.
                - I can identify and penalize blockers who illegally destroy the pack so my peer IPR/HR can focus on other game action.
