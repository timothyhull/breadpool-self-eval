### NSO Example #1 - JT

??? video "Calm Precision and Attention to Details During Intense Game Situations :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈1:44:42 mark in this video, while serving as a JT, a TTO is about to end before the game's final jam (18).
        - The game is closely contested, decided by each team's final scoring trip after a full two-minute jam.
        - I calmly performed the following actions:
            - Ended the TTO after exactly 60 seconds.
            - Quickly performed my pre-jam checks before immediately starting the jam.
            - Discretely approached the HR (≈1:45:43 mark) to advise them that:
                - The period clock expired.
                - The jam will last for two minutes since the Lead Jammer lost lead.  
            - Observed the team benches throughout the remainder of the jam for indications that either team intended to request an OR.
            - Used a verbal cue to advise the HR when there were ten seconds remaining in the jam (≈1:46:49 mark).
            - Performed the jam-ending call-off procedure with each of the following happening at the exact same time (≈1:46:59 mark):
                - The first tap of my hips.
                - The fourth blast from my whistle.
                - The jam clock reaching 0:00.
            - Observed the SBO add the final points to determine if an overtime jam was necessary (it was not).
            - Returned to a position adjacent to the Pivot Line while monitoring my stopwatch to ensure thirty seconds elapsed before the game result could become final.
            - After they became available, I advised the HR that it had been over thirty seconds since the jam ended and that I could indicate the game was final whenever they were ready (≈1:47:30 mark).
            - Waited for the HR's indication that the game should become final before immediately blowing my whistle to signal the final outcome (≈1:47:37 mark).

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - A close, intense game ended normally.
        - The HR had essential game and jam clock information throughout the jam without taking their eyes off the on-track action.
        - Neither team requested an OR to contest any timing.
        - The game outcome became final after the required wait period and after receiving instructions from the HR.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - Although the outcomes for this situation may seem underwhelming, I believe this is an example of how a JT can be somewhat of a safety net for their HR throughout a game, helping ensure it runs as smoothly as possible.
        - I want my HRs to know they trust me to calmly and precisely manage game timing procedures no matter how intense game action may be.
        - For me, performing JT responsibilities with precision throughout a game takes deliberate study and practice, and my ongoing preparation helped me contribute to a smooth ending in a close game.
            - The precision of my signal to the end of the TTO ensured that neither team gained an advantage by having additional time to rest, strategize, etc.
            The precision of my call-off timing ensured that neither team could score additional points after the jam clock expired.
            - I was prepared to help facilitate the correct end-of-regulation OR and OT procedures.

### NSO Example #2 - JT

??? video "Preparedness for Timely Responses to Team and Officiating Needs :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈25:58 mark in this video, while serving as a JT, the Lead Jammer (Red) will request that their JR call off the jam.
        - The jam is called off, and the Green "A" requests a TTO from their bench area.
        - I immediately respond to the TTO request, signal the TTO, communicate the appropriate information to the SBO, and position myself at the Pivot Line to perform standard TTO duties for the JT.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - The SBO stopped the official clock, and the TTO took place normally.
        - I ended the TTO exactly at 1:00 and monitored officials, players, team benches, and on-track players for readiness to start the next jam (≈27:02 mark).
        - As the lineup time approached 25 seconds, it did not appear the skating officials were ready for the next jam to start.
        - I determined the best course of action was to transition to an OTO rather than give verbal and visual cues to indicate the jam was about to start (≈27:27 mark).

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - While serving as JT, I focus on maintaining situational awareness, and I avoid the temptation to become distracted by gameplay.
        - During an active jam, I primarily focus my attention on the team bench areas and the scoreboard, and doing so allows me to:
            - Monitor the scoreboard for proper operation so I can respond immediately if there is a technical problem with CRG.
            - Monitor team benches for indications they may request a TTO or OTO when a jam ends.
        - My attentiveness to the team bench areas allowed me to immediately respond to Green's TTO request when the jam ended, ensuring the game clock did not continue to run when a team requested a stoppage.
        - My attentiveness to the officiating crew during the TTO:
            - Prevented the unnecessary confusion of issuing the "five seconds" verbal and visual cues followed by an immediate OTO.
            - Assured my officiating peers that I have their backs because I'm paying attention to the big picture view of the game so they can focus on their individual role responsibilities.

### NSO Example #3 - JT

??? video "Active Monitoring and Responsiveness to Game Actions and Risk Management Compliance :material-cursor-default-click:"

    - This example is several short videos that demonstrate the importance I place on situational awareness and responsiveness to time-sensitive actions while serving as JT.
    - Some of these examples may seem ordinary, although I believe repeatably performing ordinary tasks with precision helps support:
        - Competitive gameplay.
        - Smooth game flow.
        - Officiating crew confidence.

    === "Video #1 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈38:27 mark in this video, the lineup clock reaches 20 seconds, and I start to shift my primary attention from the team benches, monitoring for TO and OR requests, to the steps I take to start the next jam:

                1. I check the penalty box to attempt to identify the Jammers for the upcoming jam.
                2. I look toward the PBM for any indications they may need an OTO.
                3. I check the medical bench area to confirm at least one person on the medical staff is able to observe game action on the track.
                4. I check the track area to attempt to identify the Jammers for the upcoming jam.
                5. I look toward the HR for any indications they may need an OTO.
                6. I look toward the SBO and SKs for any indications they may need an OTO.

            - I am aware that this game only has one person on its medical staff, and I observe that they have their attention on an athlete in the medical bench area.                

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - When the lineup clock reaches 25 seconds, I initiate an OTO and indicate to the HR that the medical staff is not able to observe game action.
            - The HR confers with the medical staff, and, after ≈25 seconds, the HR indicates to me that medical staff are available to observe game action.
            - I immediately end the OTO and prepare to start the next jam.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - In the JT role, I have a macro point-of-view of the game and game area that allows me to monitor for potential safety issues and stop the game clock when necessary.
            - I conduct a safety check before each jam to help ensure the game remains compliant with risk management and insurance guidelines.

    === "Video #2 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈1:17:52 mark in this video, the jam is about to end.
            - As soon as the jam ends, the Green team "A" requests a TTO.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I signal the TTO and simultaneously stop the game clock the moment the jam-ending whistles conclude.
            - The TTO started immediately, without requiring the "A" or "C" to seek the attention of an official.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - My immediate responsiveness to the TTO request ensured the game clock stopped without delay, supporting whatever the Green team's clock management strategy may have been.
            - I position myself during a jam to respond to timeout requests at any moment, and I believe that preparedness and immediate responsiveness helps build trust between officiating crews and teams.

            **This video demonstrates the same scenario as the previous video in a different game**

            - At the ≈30:00 mark in this video, the jam is about to end.
            - As soon as the jam ends, the Black team "A" requests a TTO.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I signal the TTO and simultaneously stop the game clock the moment the jam-ending whistles conclude.
            - The TTO started immediately, without requiring the "A" or "C" to seek the attention of an official.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - My immediate responsiveness to the TTO request ensured the game clock stopped without delay, supporting whatever the Green team's clock management strategy may have been.

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈1:32:42 mark in this video, the jam clock is about to expire.
            - I advise the HR that there are 10 seconds remaining in the jam.
            - I call off the jam when it expires.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - The jam ended naturally and the game transitioned into lineups.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - I performed the jam-ending call-off procedure by aligning the first tap of my hips, the fourth blast from my whistle, and the jam clock reaching 0:00.
            - The precision of this jam-ending call-off is not an accident; I regularly practice this timing so I can be as accurate as possible during game action.
            - A precise call-off ensures that time-sensitive actions within a game (penalty box timing, points scoring, etc.) are accurate and fair.

            - At the ≈45:55 mark in this video, I am about to end a brief OTO I initiated to ensure the medical staff was available to monitor game action.
            - After I end the OTO, I give the verbal and visual cues to indicate I will start the next jam in 5 seconds.
            - As I conduct my pre-jam-start check, I observe SBO give me an indication that they need an OTO.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I immediately started a new OTO, and, after a few seconds, the SBO indicated they were ready for the next jam to start.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - I am diligent about performing pre-jam-start checks before every jam so I don't inadvertently start a jam when doing so may be problematic.

## SO Video Clips

### SO Example #1 - HR

??? video "Identifying and Managing Uncommon Pack Scenarios :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈5:29 mark in this video, while serving as HR, I observe the pack divide across turns 1 and 2.
        - The pack moves to the front as Purple #65 falls to the ground after blocking White #9999.
        - Purple #757 skates in non-derby direction as Purple #65 returns to an upright position and the three foremost players skate in derby direction.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I use verbal and visual cues to indicate a no-pack split across three walls.
        - Purple #10 skates in derby direction to reform the pack, and I use the corresponding verbal and visual cues.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - Even though no-pack split situations aren't common when there are three distinct walls, I have enough experience, and keep myself practiced and studied so that I can correctly identify this and other uncommon no-pack situations.

### SO Example #2 - JR, OPR

??? video "Patience to Ensure a Penalty is Warranted :material-cursor-default-click:"

    - This example consists of several short videos that demonstrate that I have the patience to determine if illegal actions warrant a penalty, either at the time there is sufficient game impact, or after a jam ends.

    === "Video #1 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈4:00 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe White #39 initiate a legal block with my jammer, Purple #316.
            - The block sends my jammer airborne and into the back of the legs of White #718, causing White #718 to adopt a downed position.
            - This game is a globally-televised rematch of the 2024 WFTDA Global Championship final between the 2025 WFTDA GUR #1 and GUR #2 teams.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - I begin bringing my whistle to my mouth to penalize Purple #316 for a low block, and hear a whistle come from the HR (behind me).
            - I lower my whistle and communicate to the HR that I do not believe Purple #316 had any opportunity to avoid the contact they made with White #718.
            - I briefly discussed the situation with the HR after the jam, and we elected not issue a penalty to Purple #316.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I am familiar with the rules sufficiently to understand that this sort of contact warrants a penalty.  However, given the gravity of the game and my assessment that Purple #316 had absolutely no opportunity to avoid making illegal contact with White #718, I exercised patience to avoid mistakenly penalizing a player, especially a jammer, when discretion may be necessary.
                - If we had immediately penalized Purple #316 and later determined that a penalty was not warranted, there would have been no way to restore the advantage lost by Purple with their jammer serving a penalty mid-jam.
                - If we decided to penalize Purple #316 after the jam, the opposing team would have gained an advantage equivalent to what they would have had if we had issued a mid-jam penalty.
            - This example demonstrates that I carefully evaluate the impact my officiating decisions have on a game, always seeking to have as little impact as possible.  I would rather be certain a penalty is warranted than incorrectly penalizing a player and disadvantaging their team, even if the penalty was later removed.

    === "Video #2 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈1:11:25 mark in this video, while serving as the front OPR, I observe White #713 (pivot) initiate illegal (low) contact with Black #417 (jammer) near the apex of turns 1 and 2
            - The contact causes Black #417 to spin, and they nearly recover their balance before adopting a downed position several seconds later.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - Although I observed an illegal block, I did not immediately identify a resulting loss of position that would constitute sufficient game impact to warrant a penalty.
            - After Black #416 adopts a downed position while trying to recover their balance from the block by White #713, I issue a low block penalty to White #713.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - It's very important to me that I don't penalize players for actions that are illegal but lack sufficient impact on the game or its players to warrant a penalty.
            - This is one example of how I consistently assess game impact before issuing any penalties, patiently continuing to monitor a player after they are illegally blocked to determine if the illegal block does or doesn't warrant a penalty.

        - At the ≈20:22 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe White #25 cut one of their teammates, White #314, 
        - White #314 is in front of White #25 and skates in non-derby direction to create a bridge between the front and rear pack walls while White #25 is OOB.
        - White #25 returns to a fully upright and in-bounds position after White #314 is behind White #25.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I am in the correct position to monitor each player's relative position precisely throughout the action.
        - I use an official hand signal ("no earned pass") to indicate I am aware of and will not penalize White #25 for the action.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - Even though this detail ended up being inconsequential to gameplay, I am proactive and deliberate in my awareness of player positioning.
        - I slowly and clearly communicate my observations with a visual cue to improve the flow of potentially impactful game information.

### SO Example #4 - JR, OPR

??? video "Understanding and Quickly Processing Gameplay Rules :material-cursor-default-click:"

    - This example is several short videos that demonstrate the capacity I have to:
        - Observe and analyze small details that determine the outcome for given situations.
        - The speed at which I can process and correctly respond to nuanced scenarios.

    === "Video #1 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈1:29:53 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe Black #60 legally block my Jammer, White #359, down with their left hand OOB.
            - As Black #60 dives over the top of my Jammer to avoid falling on top of them, my Jammer briefly places their right hand on the ground and OOB, stands, and raises their right hand so it is no longer on the ground or OOB.
            - Black #97, who was in front of my Jammer, skates in non-derby direction in an attempt to draw a non-initiator cut on my Jammer.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I determined that my Jammer raised their right hand from the ground before Black #97 positioned themselves behind my Jammer, meaning my Jammer did not cut Black #97.
            - I used a non-standard hand signal to indicate that my Jammer had no more than one arm OOB when Black #97 skated behind them, and my Jammer completed their initial trip.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - There was a lot to watch in a short period of time to get to the right outcome, and I believe I correctly processed the timing of when my jammer was in and OOB, plus their position relative to other players in conjunction with that precise timing.
            - My experience with fast-paced, high-level roller derby and my ongoing and thorough study of game video help me see these situations correctly and consistently get to the correct outcome, even while avoiding contact with a player who fell at my feet.

        </center>

    === "Video #2 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈25:50 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe my Jammer, Purple #0, start to skate from the inside of the track toward the outside boundary near the apex of turns 1 and 2.
            - I observe White #39 attempt to initiate a block with Purple #0, and identify contact between White #39's right skate and Purple #0's left skate as Purple #0 moves to avoid contact with White #39 and initiate contact with White #68.
            - Purple #0 adopts a downed position.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I determined that Purple #0 adopted a downed position as a result of the contact initiated by White #39 (illegal blocking zone to illegal target zone).
            - I issued a low block penalty to White #39 because the contact resulted in Purple #0 losing position.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - This situation is an example of how my background officiating for other sports, martial arts in this case, helps me quickly identify nuanced initiation and impact while officiating roller derby games.
                - I observed White #39 make a backward sweeping motion with their right foot that clips the left foot of Purple #0.
                - Although Purple #0 initiates contact with White #68 before adopting a downed position, I believe the cause of Purple #0's fall started when their trajectory to initiate a block with White #68 was altered by low contact initiated by White #39.
            - As a BJJ official, it is essential for me to understand, at high speed, who initiates standing contact, and how it affects whether or not a competitor goes to the ground, even when mixed with other contact.
                - After the jam, I was able to share details about what I observed with a coach for White, who asked me for clarification about the contact that resulted in White #39's penalty.

    === "Video #3 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈1:32:39 mark in this video, while serving as middle OPR, I observe Black #5 legally block Yellow Jammer, #618, OOB directly in front of me.
            - As Black #5 falls OOB themselves, Yellow Jammer, who had Lead Jammer status, returns to a fully in-bounds and upright position, continues skating, and requests that their JR call off the jam.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I carefully monitor the precise timing of when Yellow Jammer adopts a fully in-bounds and upright position, and when Black #5 adopts a down/OOB position.
            - I determined that Yellow Jammer cut Black #5 before losing their superior position advantage.
            - After using a non-standard hand signal to indicate Black #5 lost their superior position advantage over Yellow Jammer, I turned my attention to Yellow Jammer to determine if they were ceding their cut.
            - When I observed Yellow Jammer requesting a call-off without apparently attempting to cede their cut, I issued a cut penalty to Yellow Jammer.
            - The Yellow team used their official review to request that we rescind the cut penalty on their jammer, and I was able to describe the timing of what I observed sufficiently to support the HR's decision to allow the cut call to stand.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - Black #5 made a great play by keeping themselves upright and in-bounds long enough to draw a cut on Yellow Jammer, and getting this call right effectively ended what had been an intense and competitive game.
            - I *had* to get this call right, and that required me to:
                - Be in the correct position to monitor the most critical actions within my zone, at the right time.
                - Understand the exact timing of several events that happen moments apart.
                - Understand gameplay rules well enough to immediately and decisively make the correct call at a pivotal junction of the game.
            - I was exactly where I needed to be, when I needed to be there, and this is the sort of precision you can expect from me in any game.

    === "Video #4 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈1:11:44 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe White #30 legally block my Jammer, Purple #88, OOB.
            - As Purple #88 skates in non-derby direction while OOB, I keep track of White #30 who has superior position on Purple #88.
            - White #30 skates in non-derby direction while remaining in bounds until Purple #76 initiates a legal block that forces White #30 to place a toe stop OOB.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - Although White #30 is in front of Purple #76, I am aware that Purple #76 now has superior position over White #30.
            - White #30 returns to a fully-in-bounds position and, now having cut Purple #76, initiates a derby action without ceding their cut.
            - While remaining in a position to follow my Jammer, Purple #88, I issue a cut penalty to White #30.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"
            - I believe this sort of cut scenario is somewhat less common than conventional cuts, and my understanding of derby rules combined with extensive practice maintaining situational awareness of the action within my area of responsibility allowed me to make what think is the correct call.

### SO Example #5 - JR

??? video "Humility, Willingness to Admit I Make Mistakes :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈19:35 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I believe I initiated what was a slightly early call-off for my Jammer, who had Lead Jammer status.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - While this is hardly ideal, I recognize I will make mistakes, and it is important to me to immediately and specifically apologize as a mechanism to acknowledge my errors and attempt to build trust with players, coaches, and my peers.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"
        - I want to show the people I serve that I care deeply about getting things right, and that I will not use/abuse the power afforded to me as an official as a platform to insist I am correct.
        - My apology to the coach is not visible on the video stream, although you will see that I apologize to the player before approaching their bench to speak with their coach.

### SO Example #6 - OPR

??? video "Use of Slow, Clear, and Visible Hand Signals :material-cursor-default-click:"

     - This example is several short videos that demonstrate the value I place on consistently using slow and clear visual cues as a mechanism to:
        - Effectively communicate with my peer on- and off-skates officials.
        - Ensure players, coaches, announcers, and spectators can identify and understand the actions I signal.

    === "Video #1 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈11:19:07 mark of this video, while serving as rear OPR, I issue a direction penalty to Red #701 for a block in non-derby direction that causes Black #271 to go out of bounds
            - Approximately 1/3 of my game history is NSO roles, and, when I am in SO roles, I pay close attention to the actions I can take as an SO to make sure NSOs easily get the information they need.
            - I frequently and specifically practice issuing penalties with slow, clear, and deliberate hand signals while continuously moving and changing direction to mimic game situations like this.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - You will see that I slowly use the hand signal to indicate a direction penalty followed by a swoop and repeat both the penalty and swoop hand signals, all while remaining in my assigned area of responsibility (on the rear wall). 

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - When I use clear and identifiable verbal and visual cues, my peer NSOs can do their jobs with less strain, promoting a better game experience for everyone.
            - Remaining in position while I issue penalties is essential to ensure I effectively officiate within my zone and allows my peer officials to remain focused on their zones.

            - At the ≈27:41 mark of this video, while serving as rear OPR, I observe Purple #07 initiate forceful contact to the head of White #215, and decide to penalize Purple #07 for a high block.
            - I deliberately use a slow and clear and visual cue to ensure my peer officials are aware of the penalized action.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - In the course of issuing the penalty to Purple #07, several blockers skate in non-derby direction.  I make a rapid movement to accelerate laterally in non-derby direction before coming to a sharp stop in alignment with the blockers reforming the rear wall.
            - Even though I had to maneuver my body rapidly, I completed the motion of the high block verbal cue while maneuvering myself.
            - The JR for Purple and both PLTs see and repeat my hand signal even though their view of me is obstructed by players and officials.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - This video demonstrates I have the skating skills, game awareness, and specific practice in the OPR role to successfully perform several actions at once, which improves my ability to effectively officiate and support my peers.

### SO Example #7 - JR

??? video "Observing Detailed Action and Immediately Issuing Accurate Points :material-cursor-default-click:"

    - This example is several short videos that demonstrate my ability to quickly and accurately track scored points.

    === "Video #1 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈27:21 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, my jammer, Black #76, will earn lead and start a scoring trip.
            - The same scoring trip will continue until the ≈28:25 mark in the video, when my jammer calls off the jam.
            - I immediately indicated to my SK that my jammer earned 3 points.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - While monitoring my jammer exit the track and return to their bench, I observe Blue #82 get the attention of one of their teammates, Blue #69, point in my direction, and tell them, "Look, the ref got the points right."
            - Blue #82 said to me, "Thank you.  I knew they didn't pass me," and I nodded in reply.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - While this may seem insignificant, especially in a game with a vast points spread, I take great pride in the accuracy of the points I award and knowing exactly which players my jammer has or has not passed.
            - It's important to me that I can be counted on for accurate points, no matter how close a game's score is, and I want teams and my peers to know they can count on me to be precise.
            - In a scoring trip that lasted over a minute, I carefully tracked passes my jammer earned on opposing players, and they did not earn a pass on Blue #82.
            - It meant a lot to me that a player appreciated my effort and accuracy; I don't think they expected me to know that my jammer had not earned a point for passing them.

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈22:42 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe my Jammer, White #408, who does not have Lead Jammer status, initiate and successfully complete an apex jump during a call-off by Purple Jammer #46.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I was able to be in a position to observe my Jammer initiate the apex jump while fully in-bounds, and land one skate in bounds in front of three opposing blockers before the end of the fourth jam-ending whistle.
            - I immediately signaled the three earned points, before the third set of jam-ending whistles.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - This situation demonstrates I have the capacity to process a lot of information simultaneously, be in the precise position to observe the location of Jammer and blocker hips at the exact moment the jam ends, and observe the exact position of the Jammer’s feet before they leave the track and as they land.
            - Whenever possible, it’s important to me to signal points immediately when a jam ends as a mechanism to:
                - Show players and coaches that I have confidence the points I’m reporting are accurate.
                - Afford the SKs and SBO maximum time to perform their responsibilities during lineups.

### SO Example #8 - JR, OPR

??? video "Use of Discretion and Judgment to Make a No-Call :material-cursor-default-click:"

    - This example is several short videos that demonstrate my use of discretion and judgment to avoid issuing penalties whenever possible.

    === "Video #1 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈4:14:45 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe Black #63 move slightly in non-derby direction to initiate a block on my Jammer, White #916, that causes my Jammer to fall.
            - I blew my whistle to issue a direction penalty to Black #63, although I made the assessment that the contact was not the reason White #916 fell.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I determined White #916 fell because they slipped on a metal maintenance cover built into the concrete track, and used my discretion and judgment to not issue a penalty to Black #63.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - While this decision may seem trivial, this game was closely contested and I felt the doubt I had about whether or not the contact initiated by Black #63 was sufficient to justify a penalty necessitated a no-call.
            - I make every effort to keep skaters on the track and in competition unless I am 100% certain an action or actions meet the criteria to warrant a penalty.
            - After reviewing the video later in the day, I believe I made the correct call.

    === "Video #2 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈16:19 mark of this video, while serving as rear OPR, I observe White #422 initiate a block that causes Purple #117 to step the right-front wheel of their right skate OOB.
            - I monitor Purple #117's next actions and determine they cut White #422 by immediately returning to an in-bounds and upright position in front of White #422.
            - The jam ends as I'm raising my arms to issue Purple #117 a cut penalty.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I do not issue a penalty to Purple #117 under the basis that the jam ends before I could be 100% sure they were not taking action to cede the cut.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - This video demonstrates the process I use each time I observe action that may warrant a penalty, in addition to assessing game impact, making a mental note of which players took which actions, etc.
            - Each time I observe action that may warrant a penalty, I try to find any rules-supported reason that will allow me to *not* penalize a player.
            - Although this strategy isn't perfect and sometimes results in me failing to issue a penalty that I should issue, I take the act of penalizing and removing a player from the track seriously, and I would rather mistakenly leave a player on the track than erroneously send them to the penalty box and potentially impact the competitive balance of a game.

    === "Video #3 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈37:18 mark of this video, while serving as rear OPR, I observe White #39 initiate a block that causes Purple #07 to step the left-front wheel of their left skate OOB.
            - From my point-of-view, it appeared that Purple #07 cut by returning to an upright and in-bounds position in front of White #39.
            - Purple #07 does not cede the apparent cut, and I am slightly behind a position that would allow me to accurately determine the exact position of White #39 and Purple #07.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I do not issue a penalty to Purple #07 under the basis that I was not in position to determine if Purple #07 actually cuts White #39.
            - I use a no-earned-pass visual cue to indicate to my peers that I cannot issue a cut penalty based on the information I have.
            - When I review the video, it is clear to me that I missed a legitimate cut because I was too far behind the action.
            - While I would love to be in the best possible position to observe the most relevant game action at all times, this is a case where I did not anticipate gameplay sufficiently and ended up about .5 seconds late getting to where I needed to be to observe Purple #07 cut White #39.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - Although I'm disappointed in myself for the mistake, I recognize I will make mistakes in every game, and I want to do the best I can to avoid worsening a situation.
            - This video demonstrates I am not going to guess at whether or not I should issue a penalty; I either have the information I need, or I don't.
            - Had I been asked about the situation by a player or coach, or had their been an OR, I would have responded by stating, "I was not in position to accurately observe the action."
            - While that response is not ideal, I would rather fall on that sword than issue a penalty without the appropriate vantage point and have my CHR have to manage complaints or an OR that asserts I was not in position to issue a penalty I just issued.
            - Anecdotally, reviewing this game footage provided an opportunity to learn to better anticipate how to position myself in similar situations.

### SO Example #9 - JR

??? video "Track, Pack, and Engagement Zone Location Awareness :material-cursor-default-click:"

    - This example is several short videos that demonstrate how I monitor and maintain awareness of the pack and engagement zone, even when I am not serving in a role that's responsible for doing so.
    - Keeping situational awareness of the pack and engagement zones helps me understand whether player actions I observe are legal or not.

    === "Video #1 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈33:26 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, my Jammer, Blue #1958, is released from the penalty box, near turn 4, and skates in the OPR lane in non-derby direction toward the rear of the pack, in the straightaway between turns 2 and 3.
            - White Blocker #220 and White Jammer #177, while not returning to the track from the penalty box, are also in the OPR lane skating in non-derby direction toward the rear of the pack.
            - White Blocker #220 will re-enter the track first, followed by White Jammer #177, followed by my Jammer, Blue #1958.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - I determine that Blue Jammer re-enters the track in a fully upright and in-bounds position in front of White #220, seemingly well within the rear engagement zone of a clearly defined pack.
            - I had neither seen nor heard any indication from my peer officials that any players were OOP, so I immediately turned to the HR/rear IPR and asked if White #220 was in play when Blue Jammer re-entered the track.
            - After confirmation, I assessed an illegal reentry penalty to Blue Jammer for returning to the track from the penalty box in front of an opposing blocker and failing to cede the position they illegally gained.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - This is an example of how I do more than simply follow my jammer around the track. I monitor their location relative to other players and note where my peer officials define the location of the pack and engagement zones.
            - This clip also demonstrates that I am not seeking opportunities to immediately penalize players for illegally reentering the track.  Instead, I am mindful to afford players an appropriate amount of time to cede a cut.
                - Had my jammer shown any indication they were moving toward a track boundary or had been knocked or fallen down or OOB, I would have afforded them more time to cede before issuing a cut penalty.

    === "Video #2 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈1:00:35 mark in this video, while serving as a JR and my Jammer, White #33, standing in the penalty box, I raise my right hand and finger to indicate who I believe the foremost pack skater is, so I can assess the position of the front engagement zone and be sure that White #33 legally reenters the track after they are released from the penalty box.
            - I continued to monitor the foremost pack skater’s location until White #33 left the penalty box and reentered the track, which occurs at the ≈1:00:43 mark in this video.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - Although White #33’s reentry point is not visible in the video, I carefully monitored the position of the front engagement zone and determined that White #33 entered approximately 18.5’ in front of White #1975 (before White #1975 left the pack and enters the front engagement zone themselves).
            - I waited for White #33 to make a derby move, and they continued to skate forward instead of ceding their illegal reentry, so assessed an illegal reentry penalty to White #33.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - This is another example of how I pay close attention to what's happening in the game, independent of my jammer, and the attention to detail I pay to ensure a player doesn't illegally gain an advantage over their opponent.

### SO Example #10 - JR

??? video "Awareness of the Unconventional Use of an Illegal Blocking Zone to Gain Position :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈2:20:04 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observed Black #77 initiate a jump in the apex of turns 1 and 2.
        - I observed Black #77 use their hand to brace themselves on my Jammer, White #18, during their apex jump, and successfully gain position on White #18 and White #417.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - While maintaining position to follow my Jammer, I issued a forearm penalty to Black #77 with the additional verbal cue, “*bracing on an opponent*.”

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - This example shows I have the capacity to assess the game impact of illegal actions quickly and appropriately penalize athletes who gain an advantage using, in this case, an illegal blocking zone, even in ways that may not seem obvious.

### SO Example #11 - JR, OPR

??? video "Body Positioning, Lateral Movement, Rapid Acceleration/Acceleration, Advanced Stop Techniques, and Player Positioning Awareness :material-cursor-default-click:"

    - This example consists of several short videos that demonstrate that I have the skating skills and speed to keep myself precisely aligned with some of the world's most athletic and elite players.
    - My skating skills afford me the capacity to concentrate on monitoring nuanced details of gameplay and determining the appropriate officiating responses in real-time with high accuracy.

    === "Video #1 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈46:33 mark in this video, while serving as the rear OPR, jammers for both teams are knocked out of bounds near the pivot line, and all on-track blockers begin skating in non-derby direction.
            - All blockers continue skating in non-derby direction for ≈one-and-a-quarter laps.
            - This is the silver medal game in the 2025 MRDA Championship tournament, and a rematch of the 2024 MRDA Championship gold medal game.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - I skate backward in non-derby direction at a sufficient speed to be able to maintain my position with the rearmost blockers until I reach the pivot line and observe that the front OPR has repositioned to the rear OPR position, temporarily making me the middle OPR.
                - Approximating our positions on the track as this non-derby direction skating takes place, I skate nearly 100' further than the players on the track, adjusting my speed in the straightaways and turns to maintain position integrity.
            - I actively maintain eye contact with players within my zone of responsibility throughout the duration of the non-derby direction skating.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - My ability to remain in position is intentional; I regularly practice this technique even though this is the first time I employed it in a game.
            - I prepare myself to have the skating skills to maintain position and observe relevant game action within my zone of responsibility, even in scenarios that are uncommon.

    === "Video #2 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈5:29:31 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, my Jammer, Black #10 will immediately earn lead, speed around the track, and start the first of four scoring trips before calling off jam.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - Scoring trip #1 is relatively uneventful, and I use a combination of power slides and backward plow stops to maintain precise alignment with my jammer.
            - During scoring trip #2, my jammer fluidly navigates blocks by opposing players, and I transition to backward skating to:
                - Put myself in the best position to observe earned passes.
                - Create a narrow profile that occupies as little space as possible.
                - Retain the ability to stop and rapidly change directions as needed with immediacy.
                - Exit the pack and engagement zone area with the front of my body facing my jammer for as clear a point of view as possible.
            - During scoring trip #3, I observed Red Blocker #101 legally block my jammer, although they sustained the block until they forced my jammer into making contact with the head and neck area of a downed player, Red #1018.
                - I was able to determine the initiation, assess impact, and sufficiently understand roller derby rules to penalize the Red #101 instead of mistakenly penalizing my jammer for initiating a block on a downed opponent.
                - After issuing the appropriate verbal and visual cues to assess the penalty, I calmly and confidently replace my whistle in my mouth and return my arms and hands to the correct positions.
                - I maintain precise alignment with my jammer throughout the process of assessing the penalty.
            - During scoring trip #4, I observed Red Blocker #4 make contact with my jammer's head and neck area, which I determined was sufficiently forceful to warrant a high block penalty.
                - I blow my whistle and start to issue a high block penalty before I stop because I hear the HR/rear IPR start to issue a penalty to Red Blocker #4.
            - I start to call off the jam at the exact time my jammer taps their hips for the second time, and I signal points simultaneously with the first set of four jam-ending whistles.
            - I follow my jammer back to their bench to observe for any actions that may constitute some form of response.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - I want to be the best at what I do, and I work hard to improve even the most minor details of how I officiate.  Some of the things I intentionally do during every jam include: 
                - Raising my hand to indicate points during scoring trips as close to the moment as possible that my jammer exits the front engagement zone.
                - Aiming and adjusting the direction of my hand so it faces the scoring table at all times.
                - When appropriate, I accelerate while skating backward with my jammer as they exit the front engagement zone to keep them within my direct line of sight.
                - Following my jammer back to their bench after each jam so I can observe anything they do or that happens to them.

### SO Example #12 - JR

??? video "Controlled, Mid-Corner, Rapid Stop and While Maintaining Position  :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈54:23 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, my Jammer, White #700 will earn lead, rapidly exit the front engagement zone, and approach the rear of the pack at high speed.
        - My Jammer realizes they do not have much time before the opposing Jammer will approach the pack and score points for themselves.
        - My Jammer rapidly decelerates and negotiates the pack for a few seconds before calling-off the jam.
        - The players in this game are all RCR TT skaters, making the game representative of elite-level play.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I had to rapidly accelerate to maintain alignment with my Jammer on their scoring trip, respond to and match their rapid deceleration in a compressed space (the middle of a turn), maintain accurate alignment with my Jammer to track earned passes, and respond to the jam call-off request immediately.
        - I used a single-leg backward plow stop technique to perform a controlled stop that allowed me to remain in position, not occupy more space than absolutely necessary, and move laterally through the apex of the turn in alignment with my Jammer.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I specifically practice this exact stop technique and scenario because it is difficult to get right, and this example demonstrates I exhibit the skating skills and body positioning required to officiate fast-moving derby with elite-level players and teams.

### SO Example #13 - ALTR, OPR

??? video "ALTR Readiness and Rapid Activation  :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the beginning of this video, while serving as the ALTR, I am standing between the Deus and bleachers while observing the game and taking notes.
        - Jam 7 of the 2nd period ends, and, off-camera, the rear OPR approaches me to indicate they need temporary relief from the game.
        - Just before jam 8 starts, I position myself near the Jammer Line to serve as the rear OPR.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - The game continued without a clock stoppage or gap in officiating coverage.
        - I was able to sit, remove my helmet and the black NSO top that covered my referee stripes, replace my helmet, and position myself to substitute for the rear OPR before jam 8 started.
        - I substituted for seven jams before the rear OPR was ready to resume their position.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - My readiness helped my crew keep the game flowing and on schedule, avoiding a gap in officiating coverage or potential delay of several minutes while I geared up and warmed up.
        - It's not ordinary for an ALTR to activate without stopping the game clock, and I am proud that my state of preparedness supported contiguous gameplay.
        - In the ALTR role, I keep myself ready to enter the game at any moment of need, and I had warmed up before the game and again at intermission, so my body was prepared for physical activity.
        - Although I expected to serve in the ALTR role throughout the game, I kept engaged with the game action for the event that I would need to activate.
        - This video demonstrates the importance I place on the ALTR role, how I do whatever I can to support optimal game/event flow, and the level of readiness and engagement I maintain throughout a game while serving in the ALTR role.

        - Having sufficient information to determine the contact initiation and resulting game impact meet the criteria to issue a penalty, I issue a forearm penalty to green #51.
        - The jam ends a few seconds later, and the Green "A" approaches me to express that they believe the action did not have sufficient impact to warrant a penalty.

        - Although I felt comfortable with my decision to issue the penalty, I did not argue my case to the Green "A" because I thought doing so would be counterproductive.
        - I patiently listened to the Green "A" express their disagreement/dissatisfaction and validated their argument by nodding and saying "okay" to acknowledge their feedback.
        - The Green "A" returned to their bench and the next jam started without incident.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - For me, this action is a key element to officiating effectively and building trust with players and coaches.
        - I believed the Green "A" wanted to express their opinion to me, not argue with me, and I feel confident that arguing would have escalated the situation.
        - I estimated that Green "A" needed to express frustration, and I want to earn their trust by listening to understand them, not listening to respond to or argue with them.
        - This video shows an example of how I treat others with respect and kindness at all times, even when competitive emotions run high.

### SO Example #15 - OPR

??? video "Positioning Precision, Hustle, & Peer Communication :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - The 1:15:44 mark of this video is the start of jam 17 in period 2.
        - This is a playoff game that determines which team will earn a position in the 2024 WFTDA Global Championship Tournament.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - I am the rear OPR, and although nothing extraordinary happens in this jam, this jam is a good example of how you can expect me to officiate for any level of play.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - You will observe me:
        
            1. Continuously adjusting my position to have as precise a point of view of relevant game action as possible.
            2. Using sharp movements to accelerate and decelerate, even in small spaces, to improve my positioning precision.
            3. Sprinting, even in small spaces, to be exactly where I need to be.
            4. Using lateral movement techniques like tracking, cross-pulls, and power slides that allow me to keep my body facing the pack, give me the widest possible angle to observe game action, and afford me the flexibility to quickly change direction and accelerate at any moment.
            5. Using non-standard visual cues, hand signals, and head movements to relay information to my peer officials.

        - At the ≈1:16:35 mark, one of the JRs issues a penalty to White #39, who appears to illegally exit the track.
        
            1. Understanding the severity of issuing a player a second penalty, especially in a playoff game, I point at the player to get the attention of my CHR so they can determine if they want to issue a second penalty (they do).

        - At the ≈1:16:46 mark, the front OPR issues a penalty to Purple #11 (blocker) that the front IPR repeats, in order to relay the call to the player.

            1. Purple #117 (Jammer) hears the repeated penalty call, and, apparently believing they have their own penalty, leaves the track to self-report to the penalty box.
            2. Suspecting #117 may not have a penalty, I immediately start pointing and verbally relaying my observation to my peer officials who return Purple #117 to the track with only minimal impact to gameplay.

### SO Example #16 - IPR

??? video "Use of Skating Techniques to Recover and Maintain Accurate Positioning :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈1:45:47 mark in this video, while serving as front IPR, the pack is about to transition from "all" to "front."
        - I am monitoring the pack movement and use a verbal and visual cue to inform players and officials that I temporarily assumed control of the primary pack definition responsibility from the rear IPR.
        - In the transition of the pack definition to my responsibility, Blue #26 accelerates forward more quickly than I anticipate while they chase Green Jammer forward.
        - I end up slightly out of the optimal position, with Blue #26 now in front of my position and the rest of the pack gaining speed. 

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I never want to be out of position, although this sort of situation is something I routinely practice and drill so I can get back into position immediately.
        - I sprint forward to catch Blue #26 just as they begin to reduce their speed, so I transition to a power slide technique that allows me to return to the appropriate position, observe the status of the players in my zone, and stay out of the path of the Blue Jammer's JR.
        - At the end of the power slide, as the JR and I approach turn 3, I use a two-stage pivot technique, shifting to my right and then back to my left to ensure I:

            1. Make sure the Blue JR has a clear path to remain in position with their Jammer.
            2. Quickly shift to a position along the inside boundary, looking back at the pack, that allows me to observe the rear IPR, the status of the pack, and player actions.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - These actions may seem unremarkable, although I want to point out they do not happen, at least for me, by accident.
        - These are the sorts of skating techniques I practice every week.  I frequently study game film to understand how I can move myself to improve my positioning, develop drills that help me build new skills, and repeat the drills until I perform the actions in a game without having to think about them.
        - I share this so you are aware of the sort effort and discipline you can expect from me during my preparation to be a member of any officiating crew.

### SO Example #17 - OPR

??? video "Attention to Details to Avoid Issuing a Penalty :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈4:32 mark of this video, while serving as rear OPR, I observed Purple #48 initiate a block on White #42 with a legal blocking zone to a legal target zone.
        - Purple #48's block causes White #42 to fall on top of Purple #88 who is seemingly in a down position at the time of the contact.
        - I blow my whistle to issue a misconduct penalty to Purple #48 for blocking White #42 into a downed player (Purple #88).

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - Although I blew my whistle inadvertently, I observed that Purple #88 met the criteria for "upright" at the time White #42 makes contact with them (as a result of Purple #48's block).
        - I used a non-standard hand signal (hand waive) to indicate I have no penalty to issue/report.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - The way I positioned myself allowed me to observe specific details I needed to avoid issuing a penalty, even though the contact had the visual appearance of potentially warranting a penalty.
        - This video demonstrates the close attention I pay to the details of game actions and how the results of those actions should be interpreted by the WFTDA rules.

### SO Example #18 - JR

??? video "Identifying and Tracking Complex Non-Initiator Cut Scenarios :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the beginning of this video, while serving as a JR for Black Jammer #411, I observe Red blocker #508 force my Jammer OOB near the center of turn 1 on the outside of the track.
            - I observed the middle OPR point to indicate that Red #508 initiated the block that sent Black #411 OOB.
            - I note that all other Red blockers are in front of Black #411 when Red #508 blocks Black #411 OOB.
        - I observe Black #3 force Red #508 OOB near the entrance of turn 1 on the outside of the track, and I am aware that Red #508 has now lost and cannot regain their superior position advantage over Black #411.
        - I observe Red Pivot #3 skate in non-derby direction toward the rear engagement zone, and I mind the rear IPR's verbal cue that the pack is now "front."
        - I monitor Black #411 as they attend to an apparent malfunction of their left skate while observing all Red non-pivot blockers skate in non-derby direction.
        - Black #411 returns to an upright position and skates in non-derby direction while still OOB.
        - The rear IPR issues an OOP warning to Red #3 and Black #411 moves to return to an in-bounds position in front of Red #3.
        - Red #3 begins to skate forward, and I hear the rear OPR use a verbal cue to indicate Red #3 is back in play before I observe Black #411 return to a fully in-bounds position.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - After waiting a few moments to determine if Black #411 would take immediate action to return OOB and cede their position, I issued a cut penalty to Black #411 for illegally gaining position on Red Pivot #3.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - This sort of situation has some complexities and is often misunderstood by players and coaches who believe Black #411 may legally reenter the track in front of Red #3 because Red #3 went OOP.
        - My active awareness of player positioning and monitoring of superior position status allows me to recognize that:
            - Red #3, as a player who did not initiate the block that sent Black #411 OOB, briefly lost their superior position over Black #411 when they went OOP at the trailing edge of the rear engagement zone.
            - Red #3 reestablished their superior position over Black #411 after returning to the rear engagement zone.
            - Black #411 illegally gained position on Red #3 using the OOB area (cut) and did not take immediate action to cede the cut.
        - The rear IPR communicates with me to confirm that I am aware that Red #3 went OOP, and I respond by indicating that Red #3 is a "non-initiator" who reestablished their superior position before Black #411 returned to an in-bounds position.
        - This video demonstrates the following:
            - My detailed attentiveness to tracking player positioning at all times so I can determine if a player illegally gains position using the OOB area.
            - My understanding of roller derby rules regarding gaining, losing, and reestablishing superior positioning for OOB block initiators and non-initiators alike.
            - My confidence to assess a penalty that I am nearly certain will draw enthusiastic objection from the player, their captain, their peers, and their coaches.

### SO Example #19 - IPR

??? video "Contact Initiation and Game Impact Assessment :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈37:08 mark of this video, while serving as front IPR, I observed Green #11 and Blue jammer, #37, make contact with their lower legs.
        - The contact causes Green #11 to immediately fall and Blue Jammer falls about a second afterward.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - I determined that Green #11 used an illegal blocking zone to initiate contact with an illegal target zone on Blue Jammer, which caused Blue Jammer to adopt a downed position.
        - I issued a low block penalty to Green #11 and directed them to report to the penalty box with the appropriate whistle signal plus verbal and visual cues.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - Making the correct calls or no-calls can be difficult, especially when a lot happens at once or at high speed and I never want to mistakenly penalize a player for contact they should not be penalized for, no matter how the contact appears to the untrained eye.
            - Correctly assessing contact initiation and identifying appropriate game impact before I issue a penalty is essential to me, and I believe my actions resulted in the correct outcome for this situation.
            - I diligently work to observe player movement continuously during game action so I can correctly identify the initiator(s) of contact and whether or not the contact is legal.
        - In this case, although both players were moving toward each other at the time of the contact which caused both players to fall, I believe I correctly assessed that Blue Jammer had an established skating trajectory and Green #11 initiated the illegal low contact.
        - Instead of immediately blowing my whistle after I observed the illegal low contact, I intentionally waited and continued to observe Blue Jammer for indications of game impact that resulted from the contact.
            - As soon as I observed Blue Jammer fall, I have the information I need to issue a penalty (initiation and impact) and explain it in detail if necessary.
        - I intentionally spend almost twelve seconds issuing the appropriate verbal and visual cues while continuously skating and observing my assigned zone so my peer officials and any interested observers can clearly identify the penalty and the official responsible for issuing the penalty.

### SO Example #20 - IPR

??? video "Calmness, Composure, and Pack Precision While Under Pressure :material-cursor-default-click:"

    - This example is several short videos from a single JRDA L3 regulation game where I serve as the front IPR.
    - The game had been mostly straightforward to officiate for the first ≈40 minutes of game clock time, although a few factors may have contributed to a significant increase in the officiating workload over the final ≈20 minutes:
        - This was the first game of an HT season for each team after their off-season.
        - Many of the players were playing in their first-ever game.
        - It was a hot, late-summer day, and the venue was particularly warm.
        - The athletes may have been tiring from intense, physical play.
    - I work hard to keep my body and mind in peak condition so I can function effectively, calmly, and accurately in challenging conditions and game situations knowing that my ability to officiate professionally and with composure regardless of the conditions can help deescalate tense situations and prevent difficult situations from escalating.
    - These videos highlight my:
        - Physical conditioning and ability to perform with precision in high and extreme-heat situations.
        - Mental preparation to remain focused and attentive to the important details that happen during game action.
        - Intense weekly practice to remain sharp and continuously improve and refine both my skating and officiating skills.

    === "Video #1 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈1:12:39 mark in this video, while serving as front IPR, the pack is about to transition from "all" to "front," temporarily transitioning primary pack definition responsibility to me. 
            - While monitoring pack definition, I observed Blue #018 initiate legal contact with Green #33 which caused Green #33 to step OOB while in front of Blue #018.
            - Green #33 returns to a fully upright and in-bounds position in front of Blue #018.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I issue a cut penalty to Green #33 for illegally gaining position on Blue #018 using the OOB area.
            - I monitor Green #33 exiting the track and issue them an illegal procedure penalty for illegally exiting the track using a prolonged trajectory.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - I have a lot to observe and manage over a short period of time, and I believe I do so clearly, correctly, calmly, and effectively.
            - I demonstrate that I can calmly manage all of the following simultaneously:
                - Continuously monitoring gameplay for the presence of a pack.
                - Remain aware of which players have and earn superior position over other players.
                - Track the relative positions of Green #33 and Blue #018 before and after contact.
                - Assess the transition of the pack from "front" to "all" to determine where to position myself.
                - Observe Green #33's trajectory as they exit the track.
                - Determine that game conditions allow me to briefly leave my position so I can approach the PLT for Green to ensure they are aware of the second penalty.
                - Slowly, deliberately, and clearly deliver the appropriate verbal and visual cues for the penalties I issued.
                - Relay a direction penalty from the rear OPR to the PLTs.

    === "Video #2 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈1:21:44 mark in this video, a no-pack situation occurs, and I have to quickly co-determine with my peer IPR/HR whether the destruction of the pack was natural and legal or unnatural and illegal.
            - Just after the no-pack occurs, an OOP block with sufficient game impact to warrant a penalty occurs in the coverage zone of the rear IPR/HR that they need to attend to, and I am not immediately able to determine their perspective regarding the pack destruction.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - I determined Blue #555 illegally destroyed the pack by accelerating in the counterclockwise direction at a pace that deviated from the established pack speed.
            - I assessed an illegal position penalty to Blue #555 for unnatural pack destruction.

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - A lot happens within a few seconds, and I take quick, decisive, and accurate actions:
                - I visualize the "lasagna slice" shape of the distance between Blue #555 (near the inside boundary) and the nearest Green blocker (in the middle of the track) and assess Blue #555's trajectory (toward the middle of the track) and acceleration relative to the speed of the rest of the pack.
                - As I monitor Blue #555 destroy the pack, I turn my head slightly to the right to determine the foremost Green blocker's speed and trajectory and understand if they might be responsible for the pack destruction (legally or illegally) while concurrently issuing a "no-pack" warning.
                - I determined that Blue #555 illegally destroyed the pack, and I made a mental note to not include them in the process of redefining the pack.
                - I quickly look to my right and left to account for all blockers, observe blocker movement, determine if blockers are taking the appropriate actions to reform the pack, and continue monitoring the distance between blockers from both teams.
                - I issue a second "no-pack" warning, check the distance between blockers from both teams (excluding Blue #555, who I know to be a penalized player), and issue the verbal cue "pack is here" as the pack reforms.
                - I immediately assess the pack destruction penalty to Blue #555 just as the jam ends.
            - I practice extensively to have the capacity to manage these sorts of situations with speed and precision.  Specifically, and that includes:
                - Practicing pack definition for several hours each week with varying levels of skill and competitiveness.
                - I obsessively study game video of my own pack definition and that of other officials to learn how I can improve.
                - I augment my game video study by mocking up various in-game pack scenarios with [Track-Viz :octicons-link-external-24:](https://trackviz.netlify.app "Track-Viz Roller Derby Pack Simulation Tool"){ target=_blank } to help me better visualize pack geometry and improve the speed and precision at which I can monitor and process pack dynamics.

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈1:22:25 mark in this video, while serving as front IPR, a sustained no-pack situation occurs.
            - Players from both teams do not immediately take appropriate actions to reform the pack, and several players commit actions that have sufficient impact to warrant penalties.
            - It is not clear to the JRs whether Lead Jammer status is available or lost.
            - It is my responsibility to:
                - Issue "no-pack" warnings until the pack reforms.
                - Identify and track any players who commit penalties within my coverage zone (the front wall, in this case).
                - Use clear verbal and visual cues to indicate when the pack reforms.
                - Clearly communicate penalty assessment to my on- and off-skates peer officials so they have the information they need to do their jobs.
                - Ensure the JRs understand the availability of Lead Jammer status.
                - Remain in position to continue observing game action.

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - Before the pack reforms, I determine that:
                - Blue Jammer (#277) initiates OOP contact with Green #616, which causes Green #616 to adopt a downed position.
                - Green #03 is the blocker most responsible for reforming the pack and fails to take the required action(s) to do so.
            - When the pack reforms, I issue the verbal cue "pack is here" and immediately start the process to assess the appropriate penalties.
                - The JR for Blue doesn't have a way of knowing that I intend to assess a penalty to Blue Jammer, and they begin to use the whistle signal and visual cue to issue Lead Jammer status.
                - I am already moving into position to issue an illegal contact penalty to Blue Jammer (for an OOP block with game impact) to help reduce confusion about Lead Jammer status availability.
                - As soon as I issue the penalty to Blue Jammer, I make a rapid direction change to return to my position and immediately issue an illegal position penalty to Green #03 for failure to reform the pack.
            - I observe my peer IPR penalize Blue #21 and I identify that there are only three blockers on the track.
                - I determine that the current pack formation does not require the attention of two IPRs, and, while keeping my body facing the pack, I skate toward the PLTs to ensure they have all of the information they need to track the surge of penalties.
            - I return to my position at the front of the pack after communicating with the PLTs for ≈5 seconds and observe the Green Jammer establish superior position over all blockers, although the JR does not immediately indicate Lead Jammer status.
                - The JR for Green turns their head toward me to ask if Lead Jammer status is open.
                - I reach my right hand to my left hand to feel for an assistive device that I habitually use to track Lead Jammer availability.
                - I feel the position of the assistive device and determine that Lead Jammer status is open, so I turn my head toward the JR for Green and say, "Open, open, open."
                - The Green JR immediately issues Lead Jammer status.        

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - I believe the front IPR position is more challenging than it may appear to the untrained eye.  In my opinion, a well-practiced IPR excels at:
                - "Owning" their own coverage zone while providing supporting coverage and communication to their peer SOs and NSOs.
                - Rapid task switching between pack definition, contact initiation assessment, player position changes, lead jammer status, etc.
                - Rapid backward acceleration, backward skating at high speed, immediate stops and direction changes, continuously positioning themselves to observe the most relevant game action, and ensuring that JRs have unobstructed lanes.
                - Understanding track geometry through its turns and how it impacts the distance between players and the shape of the engagement zone.
            - I extensively study and practice the front IPR position to embody these traits so I can manage complex situations like this one while supporting and advising my peer officials.

    === "Video #4 :material-cursor-default-click:"

        === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - At the ≈1:24:49 mark in this video, while serving as front IPR, Green #616 attempts to create a bridge between the front and rear blocker walls.
            - A series of events happen nearly simultaneously, which causes Green #616 to illegally destroy the pack:

                1. All on-track blockers are part of an established pack with clearly defined front and rear walls as Green #616 leaves the penalty box, legally enters the track, and skates in derby direction until they reach the front wall.

                    - This action and natural gameplay move the pack from "all" to "front."

                2. At the rear wall, Blue #21 initiates a block that sends the Green Jammer OOB and skates in non-derby direction to recycle the Green Jammer.

                    - Blue #21 skates more than 10 feet from the nearest blocker.
                    - Blue #21 continues skating in non-derby direction until they reach the edge of the rear engagement zone and receive an OOP warning from the rear IPR.
                    - Blue #21 responds to the OOP warning by skating in derby direction and returning to the rear engagement zone.

                3. At the front wall, Green #616 comes to a stop and begins skating in non-derby direction as Blue #21 returns to a position within 10 feet of the rear wall.

                    - The rear wall is still within the rear engagement zone and not part of the pack.

                4. Green #616 continues skating in non-derby direction until they are more than 10 feet from the front wall's rearmost blocker and within 10 feet of the foremost blocker in the rear wall.

                    - This action created two equally sized groups of blockers from both teams that were more than 10 feet apart, commonly referred to as a "no-pack, split."

        === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
        
            - Green #616 illegally destroyed the pack.
            - Even though I've yet to issue a penalty to Green #616, as a penalized skater, they are no longer part of pack definition, so the pack immediately reforms at the front wall.
            - I use the following verbal and visual cues sequentially and without delay:
                - "No-pack, split."
                - "Pack is here."
                - 1 x long whistle blast.
                - "Green #616, destruction."

        === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

            - Getting this right and in sync with the rear IPR takes a lot of practice and requires that I concurrently and precisely:
                - Measure the distance between the rearmost pack skater and Green #616.
                - Monitor Green #616's proximity to the foremost blocker in the rear wall.
                - Monitor Blue #21’s proximity to the rearmost blocker in the rear wall as Blue #21 returns to the rear engagement zone.
                - Identify whether Green #616 is skating in non-derby direction, stopped, or skating in derby direction at the exact moment the no-pack split occurs.
                - Align my measurements and timing with the rear IPR.
                - Identify and signal the pack’s destruction and immediate reformation with the appropriate verbal and visual cues.
                - Penalize Green #616 for illegally destroying the pack.
            - As my peers evaluate me, I want them to see that:
                - I am capable of correctly processing and handling complex pack dynamics in real-time, and they can trust me to support them similarly when they include me on their officiating rosters.
                - I can identify and penalize blockers who illegally destroy the pack so my peer IPR/HR can focus on other game action.
