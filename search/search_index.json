I promise to share what I\u2019ve learned with anyone who wants to better themselves, and to use what you've taught me to emphatically support derby communities of all sizes, types, and ages, anywhere and everywhere derby lives.</p> <p> JR, Franky Panky, New Jax vs. Red Stick, March, 2024         Credit: Keith Ridge Derby Photos  </p> <p>I am intent on being an official who performs exceptionally in any role, for any type and level of gameplay, under any conditions, with any crew, anywhere, and anytime.  My self-evaluation encompasses both SO or NSO positions because I don't consider myself an \"SO\" or an \"NSO.\"  I am simply an official who works to continuously learn and improve, earn the trust of my peers, and excel in each roller derby officiating role.</p> <p>I seek to continuously improve my skills in every NSO and SO position because improving in any one position sharpens me in every other position.  The more I understand the nuances of each officiating role, the more empathy I can show my peers as I work to help them be as effective and comfortable in their roles as possible.</p> <p>I don't simply want to be excellent in every officiating role; I want to be an excellent teammate and peer in every officiating role.  That means I pay close attention to how I move, position myself, complete paperwork, time my actions, and communicate so I make it easier for each of my peers to do their jobs.</p> <p>I work every single day to develop a deeper understanding of gameplay, rules theory, and the people involved in roller derby so I can support an ongoing improvement of the gameplay experience for teams, my peer officials, volunteers, spectators, and the global roller derby community.</p> <p> JT, Female Division JRDA Playoffs: Santa Cruz, June, 2024 (Timothy Hull)         Credit: Mckay Grundstein-Helvey  </p> <ul> <li>Name: Breadpool (Timothy Hull)</li> <li>Pronouns: He/Him</li> <li>Age: 45</li> <li>Home Town: Portland, Oregon, USA</li> <li>Birth Town: Annapolis, Maryland, USA</li> <li>League Affiliation: RCR</li> <li>Languages: English, Brazilian Portuguese</li> <li>Occupation: Automation Software Development Consultant</li> <li>Fun Fact: BJJ Black Belt</li> </ul> <p> JR, 187 Killer Pads vs. Triple 8, RollerCon 2024         Credit: WiK's Pics  </p> Inspiration New Hope  <p>I am a physically disabled U.S. Army veteran with double hip replacements, and I believe I fit within the category of people with hidden disabilities. I seek to inspire people who, like me, have physical disabilities to do more than they or perhaps the world believes they are capable of.</p> <p>When I serve in an officiating role, on- or off-skates, nobody sees me and thinks I\u2019m disabled, guesses I have an extensive injury history that includes 21 x surgeries, nor has any idea how much daily work I do to physically function, gear up and skate, and excel at high-intensity physical activities.</p> <p>Intense rehabilitation to recover from injuries is my superpower.  I served in SO roles within a few weeks of each of my total hip replacement surgeries because I spent hours and hours each day rehabilitating, strengthening, and specifically training to be able to skate.</p> <p>I want people with physical disabilities to see me as an example that it\u2019s possible for them to experience joy and fulfillment from strenuous sports and activities.</p> <p> OPR, RCR GNR vs. Texas Hustlers, November, 2023         Credit: Jonathan Works Photography  </p> <p>I've loved intense athletic competition for as long as I can remember, first competing in a running race at the age of 5.  I love the grind of physical preparation, the struggle of mental readiness, the joy of successes, the pain of failures, and even the process to recover from the devastation of injuries, just for the chance to compete again.</p> <p>Military service disabilities and sports injuries prevent me from competing in the sports I've spent most of my life learning, playing, and loving.  Losing the ability to compete in these sports in recent years crushed me, leaving me feeling without purpose and desperate for a way to fill the competitive athletic void in my life.</p> <p>Officiating roller derby has allowed me to feel like my chance to participate in competitive athletic activities isn't yet over because, at least for now, my body still allows me to roller skate with high intensity.  Even though I am not a competitor on the track, officiating allows me to experience the joy of competitive preparation through intense physical training, rules study, video analysis, and practicing with peers who push me to improve every day.</p> <p> HR, AoA vs. Rat City, October, 2023         Credit: Jonathan Works Photography  </p> Non-Derby Officiating Derby Officiating  <p>I am newer to officiating roller derby, although I've been officiating various sports and competitive activities most of my life.  I started officiating when I was sixteen, operating the scoreboard at high school basketball games, and I've since officiated:</p> <ul> <li>High school football.</li> <li>High school Army JROTC drill competition.</li> <li>U.S. Army recreational flag football.</li> <li>BJJ tournaments at the local, regional, and international levels.</li> </ul> <p>I\u2019ve been competing in sports throughout my life, including over 20 years of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competition. Officiating is one way I contribute to serving future generations of competitors while honoring those who officiated for my own competitive athletic experiences.</p> <p>Although each sport has unique officiating requirements and nuances, I find there are many common elements to the role of officiating across sports.  I make this point because I believe one of the reasons I've been able to integrate effectively with the roller derby officiating community within a few years is my prior officiating experience:</p> <ul> <li>Conducting myself in keeping with the professional nature of an official.</li> <li>Communicating effectively with players, coaches, other officials, staff, and spectators.</li> <li>Understanding that even the nicest people sometimes become elevated during competition, and affording them the space to be elevated without judging them or taking things personally.</li> <li>De-escalating intense situations between players, coaches, officials, etc.</li> <li>Not allowing player, coach, or crowd reactions to impact my judgment or responses.</li> <li>Observing and remembering the details of high-speed gameplay actions.</li> <li>Understanding the importance of allowing players to determine the outcome of contests.</li> <li>Remaining calm, composed, and effective during high-stakes competition.</li> </ul> <p>          Referee, The Revolution 52, Puyallup, WA, July 2024         Credit: Jason Tracy Photography  </p> <p>I began my derby officiating journey in August of 2022, although somewhat by accident.  My daughter was new to the roller derby community and wanted to spend more time on skates than was available to her in practices and scrimmages.  She decided to start attending officiating practices and asked that I join her so she wouldn't feel alone.</p> <p>I wanted to support my daughter and the roller derby community, and having skated and officiated in different capacities for most of my life, I felt comfortable giving roller derby officiating a shot.  I had no idea that I would leave that practice feeling like officiating roller derby was something I would enjoy and invest so much in.</p> <p>Since that day, I've poured my heart and soul into becoming a better official, believing I can serve people, many of whom live within social margins, in a way that allows them to live safer, more fulfilling lives.</p> <p>Where I happen to live affords me access to more opportunities to officiate roller derby than many people have, and I have access to highly experienced officials to learn from.  I do everything I can to use my privilege for good by officiating for leagues and teams that most need extra support. That means I frequently officiate roller derby:</p> <ul> <li>Outside of my home league, often in rural areas.</li> <li>For junior roller derby leagues and teams.</li> <li>For beginner-level teams, including those who play modified-contact games.</li> <li>For marginalized communities, teams, athletes, etc.</li> <li>Whether or not the gameplay is sanctioned or adheres to regulation play guidelines.</li> </ul> <p> JR, Ground Control vs. Y'allhalla, May, 2024         Credit: Alvin Green Jr. Photography  </p>"},{"location":"index.html#what-to-expect-from-me","title":"What to Expect From Me","text":"<p>I believe the best officiating happens when a crew operates as a selfless, supportive, and blameless team that focuses on being better today than they were yesterday.  These are the qualities you can expect from me as a member of any officiating crew:</p> 1. My Mindset  <ul> <li>I approach officiating just like I do playing any competitive sport, with the exception that my opponent isn't another person or team.</li> <li>In my mind, mistakes are the opponent I ferociously train to beat, while recognizing mistakes are a relentless opponent that will never allow me to be rest.</li> <li>I respect my opponent, although I do not fear them.</li> <li>I seek to challenge my opponent at the highest levels because I'm driven to \"win,\" and I prepare to be successful in the biggest moments.</li> <li>\"Winning\" means my peers and I supported safe, fair gameplay in which the competing teams feel like they control the outcome.</li> <li>I give my all to be the best teammate anyone has ever had, always seeking self-improvement and working to be someone who my peers trust, feel safe with, and love to work with.</li> </ul> 2. Extreme Positivity  <ul> <li>I show up with high enthusiasm, friendliness, excitement, and positivity to share with the officials I serve with, no matter how challenging game conditions might be.</li> <li>Regardless of the circumstances, I bring fist bumps, high-fives, and verbal \"Let's go!\" cues to support and encourage my peers throughout the duration of each contest in an event.</li> <li>I seek responsibility for my mistakes, make in-game adjustments, avoid dwelling on my mistakes so I keep my head in the game, and immediately extend apologies, where appropriate, to the people I impact with my mistakes.</li> <li>I have the backs of my on- and off-skates crewmates, always, and they can count on me to encourage them in difficult situations.</li> <li>When my officiating peers and leadership need me to make adjustments, I don\u2019t dig my heels in about doing things a certain way, I give them my full support and do what they need me to do.</li> </ul> 3. Strenuous Preparation  <ul> <li>I practice developing and improving officiating skills, on- and off-skates at least 4 hours per week, and often upwards of 10 hours per week.</li> <li>I actively seek feedback from other officials and relentlessly study game video to continuously learn and improve, and to position myself to best support safe and fair gameplay.</li> <li>I physically train and condition 5-12 hours per week to maintain a high level of fitness, improve my ability to be in the best position to observe game action, and ensure I will not experience physical fatigue no matter how strenuous the environmental or game conditions might be.</li> <li>I regularly study roller derby rules and cases to continuously develop a better understanding of roller derby rules theory because I believe learning to understand rules theory helps me quickly work through complex situations in a way that supports the best and safest possible gameplay experience.</li> </ul> 4. Empathic Listening  <ul> <li>I actively listen to officials, players, and coaches with genuine effort and concern to understand their points of view.</li> <li>I seek to build trust by showing officials and teams they are heard and understood, even in cases where we may disagree with each other.</li> <li>I actively solicit feedback from my peer officials by telling them no feedback will hurt my feelings.</li> <li>For me, feedback is information I can use to be better today than I was yesterday, and I want to understand my mistakes, not ignore or hide from them.</li> </ul> 5. Clear and Kind Communication  <ul> <li>I speak to everyone with courtesy and respect, no matter how I am spoken to.</li> <li>I do everything I can to actively communicate information with other officials in a way that promotes smooth, continuous game flow.</li> </ul> 6. Keeping Athletes on the Track  <ul> <li>I believe gameplay is best when athletes are on the track, not in the penalty box, and I observe game action in a way that seeks to avoid issuing penalties whenever possible.</li> <li>For any action that might create sufficient game impact to warrant penalties, I describe the game impact to myself in a way I can recite during an official review before I issue any penalties (e.g., \"Low block on yellow 2-4; caused purple 2-4 to go down\").</li> <li>I maximize the use of verbal warnings, prescribed by gameplay rules, to help athletes avoid committing penalties.</li> <li>When I issue penalties, I include as much \"3-star\" information as possible to help athletes understand my basis for issuing penalties and help them avoid being assessed with the same penalty again (e.g., \"Yellow 2-4, forearm; bracing on an opponent.\").</li> </ul> 7. Zone Ownership  <ul> <li>I focus on officiating specifically within the confines of my area/zone of responsibility.</li> <li>Said another way, I avoid immediately issuing penalties for actions I may not have the best point of view to observe.</li> <li>If I believe I may have observed game action outside of my zone that warrants a penalty or even warrants reversing a penalty, I seek to discuss my observations with other officials during lineups to collaborate on our points of view and reach the best possible outcome.</li> </ul> 8. Hustle  <ul> <li>No matter what I do, I move with the utmost sense of purpose, often sprinting back and forth, to show everyone around me that my concern for serving the teams and peers I officiate with is equivalent to that of the highest-level competitors.</li> <li>I apply the skills I've developed in over 20 years of BJJ and Judo training and competition to reduce the probability that I will fall and to recover from any fall with precision and explosiveness.</li> <li>If I end up on the ground, I maintain eye contact with my zone of coverage to the extent possible, and return to my assigned responsibilities immediately, even if I am in discomfort from whatever took me down.</li> </ul> 9. Versatility  <ul> <li>I actively work to keep my OHD balanced between SO and NSO roles, officiating \u22482/3 of games in SO roles and \u22481/3 of games in NSO roles.</li> <li>Whenever needed, I am comfortable and prepared to serve in any SO or NSO role, with or without advanced notice.</li> </ul> 10. Courage To Do What's Right  <ul> <li>Making split-second, difficult decisions is simply part of being an official, and I believe that applies to all levels in all sports.</li> <li>Of course, there are no prescriptive guidelines for what the \"right\" thing to do is, although my peers can count on me to use good judgment, be decisive in key moments, and own responsibility for the decisions I make, whatever the outcome.</li> </ul> <p> OPR, Female Division JRDA Playoffs: Santa Cruz, June, 2024         Credit: Mckay Grundstein-Helvey  </p>"},{"location":"index.html#my-strengths-and-areas-for-growth","title":"My Strengths and Areas for Growth","text":"<p>Please click to expand the sections below for detailed information about my development in each officiating role.</p> NSO Positions  <p>In each NSO position, you can expect me to consistently exhibit and excel at:</p> <ul> <li>Precision - accurate timing, clear communication, and adherence to established policies and procedures.</li> <li>Attention to detail - everything I do gets my absolute best effort; I do not take shortcuts, I ask questions when something seems wrong, and I do everything I can to preserve the integrity of the sport and the people within it.</li> <li>Thorough preparation - I do not rely on past experience or wishful thinking to be sure I will do a good job at something.

consistency as a JT by serving in the role more frequently.<ul> <li>I will sometimes go for several weeks without serving as a JT, and, even with advanced preparation, it may take me several jams to relax and feel like I'm not thinking about everything I'm doing and need to do.</li> </ul> </li> <li>I will sometimes focus so much on responding to and signaling timeouts as quickly as possible that

more frequently in order to maintain proficiency.<ul> <li>It may take me several jams to feel like I am performing my responsibilities without having to actively think about everything I need to do.</li> </ul> </li> <li>I typically use a \"single watch\" technique to time penalties, and some CHNSOs/HNSOs prefer a \"dual watch\" technique that I don't practice regularly.<ul> <li>For instances when only one player is serving a penalty for the team I'm assigned to track, the single and dual watch techniques are indistinguishable on the PBT paperwork.</li> <li>When multiple players are serving penalties simultaneously, I use a running clock to record the time each player sits, stands, and completes their penalty.<ul> <li>Some CHNSOs/HNSOs prefer that all players sit at 0 seconds, stand at 20 seconds, and complete service at 30 seconds, assuming I'm not recording timing for multiple penalties or a jammer swap.</li> <li>The single watch technique I use may show that a player sits at 16 seconds, stands at 36 seconds, and completes service at 46 seconds.</li> </ul> </li> <li>It's important that I continue to experiment with and practice the dual watch technique to best

retain, lose, and reestablish superior positioning as players go OOB/OOP and return to play.</li> <li>Contact initiation awareness - I thoroughly assess and understand which players initiate contact with other players during fast-paced gameplay.</li> <li>Game impact awareness - I thoroughly assess game impact, even if delayed by several seconds, before I issue or decline to issue penalties.</li> <li>Detailed situational recall - I remember and can recall detailed information about the actions I observe, including player-specific details (team and jersey number).</li> <li>Positioning - I dynamically position and reposition myself to always be in the best possible position to observe game action.</li> <li>Whistle clarity - I use clear, slow, and slightly prolonged whistle blasts to help my peer officials in SO and NSO roles understand where and when to turn their attention.</li> <li>Verbal and visual cue clarity - I use highly audible/visible, deliberately slow, and consistently repeated verbal and visual cues to help my peer officials in SO and NSO roles understand exactly what I observe and report.</li> <li>Multitask capacity -  I deliver verbal and visual cues, including penalties, while maintaining the appropriate positioning for my SO role.</li> <li>Ongoing player awareness - I maintain observation of players before, during, and after each jam to ensure any potential contact or communication between teams has oversight.</li> <li>Jam participant tracking - I continuously track the number of players and the positions for each player on each team before and during each jam.</li> <li>Rules knowledge - I understand and apply roller derby rules in keeping with established rules theory and the appropriate situational discretion and judgment to facilitate safe and fair gameplay.</li> <li>JRDA procedures familiarity - I frequently officiate JRDA games and continuously study JRDA-specific rules, risk management, sanctioning, officiating procedures, etc.</li> <li>Teamwork - I behave in a way that proactively shows inclusiveness, courtesy, support, respect, and validation to NSOs.</li> </ul> <p> JR, 187 Killer Pads vs. Triple 8, RollerCon 2024         Credit: Jenni Weber Photography </p> Skating Skills  My Strengths My Areas for Growth  <ul> <li>General and position-specific skating skills that are among the best of my peers and allow me to reliably be in the best possible position to observe the most relevant game action without consciously thinking about skating.</li> <li>Elite physical and mental conditioning and endurance due to thousands of hours of experience in high-intensity athletic training and competitive environments.</li> <li>Top-end speed, forward and backward, in derby and non-derby directions, throughout the skating surface area.</li> <li>Rapid acceleration skills, forward and backward, allow me to burst to full speed, keep pace with, and rapidly catch up to the fastest players in the world if I am forced out of position.</li> <li>Precision stops with equivalent skill to my left and right sides while moving forward and backward.</li> <li>Lateral movement skills and strong wheel-based stops (hockey stops, power slides, backward plows, etc.) allow me to face the front of my body toward the track during most gameplay situations and immediately change directions at any time.</li> <li>Body control that allows me to operate effectively and avoid obstacles in compressed spaces, including narrow OPR lanes and while adjacent to downed players.</li> <li>Footwork skills that allow me to avoid contact with players and remain upright in situations where they may not be able to avoid making contact with me.</li> <li>Situational awareness that allows me to position my body such that I create a small profile.<ul> <li>Although I am often among the taller officials I serve with (5' 10\" off-skates), I am aware of the space I occupy and use various techniques to avoid obscuring game action from my peers.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Adaptability to different track surfaces and conditions.</li> <li>Immediate and explosive returns to an upright and effective position if I fall or am forced to the ground.</li> <li>Capacity to maintain eye contact with my assigned area(s) of responsibility in almost any situation.</li> <li>Regular, at least weekly, skate maintenance to:<ul> <li>Ensure my equipment is always in peak condition.</li> <li>Vastly reduce the potential for mechanical failures.</li> <li>Quickly repair or replace components if necessary.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>While I do not frequently fall, I skate aggressively to be and remain in the best possible position to observe game action, and aggressive skating can occasionally cause me to fall.</li> <li>I use wheel stops to create a \u201cnarrow\u201d profile while moving laterally, and doing so extends my legs, which can occasionally cause contact with players and other officials.  I'm working to make my narrow profile more compact without compromising stability.</li> </ul> HR/CHR My Strengths My Areas for Growth  <ul> <li>Early partnering and preparation with my peer HNSO/CHNSO to create and demonstrate unified and collaborative officiating.</li> <li>Spending sufficient time with my crew before a game to clearly communicate my instructions, answer questions, and provide any necessary clarifications.</li> <li>Maximizing opportunities for my peers to officiate by assigning them to all available roster positions, including the ALTR position.</li> <li>Understanding of and experience with the responsibilities and procedures associated with each SO position allows me to support any member of my crew who may need help with positioning, skating techniques, and role-specific responsibilities.</li> <li>Helping develop new officials by providing safe opportunities for them to learn under my mentorship or that of other experienced officials.</li> <li>Supporting officials who are developing experience with HNSO/CHNSO roles by acting as a safety net if they need assistance.</li> <li>Helping guide and adjust the penalty game impact spectrum amongst my crew to help limit the number of player and team penalties as much as possible.</li> <li>Communicating with players and coaches in a way that seeks to understand their points of view.</li> <li>Managing game flow by:<ul> <li>Limiting the duration and frequency of OTOs whenever possible.</li> <li>Working with the JT to ensure the lineup clock reaches 25 seconds before stopping the game clock for administrative OTOs, except for injury situations.</li> <li>Clear, specific, decisive, and timely communication with teams, officials, and game audiences during ORs.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Confidence using a microphone to communicate with game audiences using terminology and descriptions that help promote a more universal understanding of roller derby rules and gameplay.</li> <li>Strategically using OTOs as a mechanism to show fair and good faith to players and coaches.  For example:<ul> <li>If a coach or captain has a concern I can't fully hear or respond to during lineups, I sometimes use OTOs when digression feels appropriate to ensure I am not dismissive of their concerns.</li> <li>If I need to address a concern with teams (too many pack penalties, excessive high contact, etc.), I will use an OTO to speak with coaches and captains rather than continuing to penalize players until a team or teams use their timeouts to address the concern with me.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Having the backs of my peer officials so they can do their jobs without concern that they are responsible for interacting with elevated or frustrated players and coaches directly.<ul> <li>I want and seek the responsibility of de-escalating and resolving conflict between teams and officials so my peers can work in an environment where they feel safe.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Remaining calm, collected, positive, and supportive during tense gameplay situations or when officiating errors occur.</li> <li>Providing in-game and post-game feedback to officials who consent to feedback.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>I often pass on opportunities to serve in an HR role within my home league so I can afford those opportunities to other officials.<ul> <li>I need to advocate for myself to seek and accept more HR responsibilities.</li> </ul> </li> <li>When assigned to an HR or CHR role, especially in a tournament when I'm working with officials who I many not be familiar with, I need to study more game video of the individual crew members to understand:<ul> <li>Their strengths and areas for growth.</li> <li>How to best position them for success.</li> <li>How to appropriately challenge them to improve.</li> </ul> </li> <li>I have no experience serving as a THR.</li> </ul> OPR My Strengths My Areas for Growth My Positioning Methodology  <ul> <li>High proficiency at each OPR position and the capacity to switch between any OPR position at any time without disrupting gameplay or creating a coverage gap.</li> <li>Being the earliest and most decisive \"dropping\" OPR in the world, seeking to rapidly stop, accelerate in non-derby direction, and recover a new position whenever the pack's speed has even the slightest potential to put me or my peers out of position.</li> <li>Awareness of earned passes within my zone of responsibility, including player details.<ul> <li>Communicating earned pass information to JRs whenever necessary.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Frequent communication with my OPR peers to ensure our collective positioning and ability to observe game actions is optimal.</li> <li>Non-verbal communication with players reporting to and returning from the penalty box to help ensure they enter and exit the track safely and avoid contact with officials.</li> <li>Lateral movement skills that allow me to predominantly face my entire body toward the pack, giving me the best possible view of the pack and allowing me to rapidly accelerate and decelerate in any direction at any time.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>I, generally, do not advocate to serve in a specific OPR position, and serve in whichever position my peers least prefer for themselves.<ul> <li>This behavior results in limited opportunities to build game experience in other OPR roles, and I need to better balance my development with my peers' requests.</li> </ul> </li> <li>I tend to be passive about my assignment-specific positioning relative to other officials, in particular when I serve in the middle or front OPR positions.<ul> <li>I typically adapt my own positioning to the positioning of my adjacent peers rather than take the more active approach of positioning myself where I believe I should be.</li> <li>If I were to take a more active approach to positioning, I believe I might invite constructive communication, debate, and feedback about how my peers and I can improve our overall positioning as an OPR unit.</li> </ul> </li> <li>I will occasionally focus so much attention on alignment with my individual zone/wall of coverage that I don't anticipate overall pack and player movement correctly.<ul> <li>For example, from the rear and middle OPR positions, I may observe player \"A\" legally block opposing player \"B\" OOB directly in front of me.</li> <li>Instead of remaining in precise alignment with my area/wall of responsibility, I need to better anticipate player \"B\" immediately attempting to reenter the track before player \"A\" can skate quickly enough in non-derby direction to draw a cut on player \"B.\"</li> <li>I am working on shifting myself slightly in non-derby direction in these situations so I can precisely observe the position of each player's hips at the exact moment player \"B\" returns to a fully in-bounds position.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>As a rear OPR, I am, generally:</p> <ol> <li>Parallel with a well-defined rear wall.</li> <li>Ready to rapidly accelerate in non-derby direction to follow and remain even with players up to the trailing edge of the rear engagement zone.</li> <li>Shifting slightly behind the rear wall when jammers approach, so I can observe contact to the rear wall.</li> <li>Periodically shifting slightly in front of the rear wall to observe for illegal blocking techniques that create game impact.</li> <li>In position to observe player positioning relative to the jammer line and outside boundary at the start of each jam.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>As a middle OPR, I am, generally:</p> <ol> <li>Parallel with a well-defined front wall of 3+ blockers.</li> <li>Ready to rapidly accelerate in non-derby direction to observe the rear wall from the front when the front wall has 2 or fewer blockers.</li> <li>Ready to reposition to be parallel with the rear wall when the rear OPR follows blockers moving in non-derby direction to the edge of the rear engagement zone, and ready to return to observing the front wall as the rear OPR reassumes control of the rear wall.</li> <li>In position to observe player positioning relative to the pivot line and outside boundary at the start of each jam.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>As a front OPR, I am, generally:</p> <ol> <li>7-12 feet in front of the pack, directly next to the outside boundary, looking in non-derby direction when the front wall has 3+ blockers.</li> <li>Ready to rapidly transition to be parallel with a front wall of 2 or fewer blockers while maintaining a position that prevents blockers from getting forward of my position.</li> <li>Ready to reposition to be parallel with the front wall when the middle OPR positions themselves to be parallel with the rear wall, and ready to return to a position forward of the front wall when the middle OPR positions themselves to be parallel with the front wall.</li> </ol> </li> </ul> JR My Strengths My Areas for Growth My Positioning Methodology  <ul> <li>Continuous, precise alignment with my jammer.</li> <li>Keeping eyes on my jammer at all times to ensure I observe everything they do.<ul> <li>When a jam ends, I track/follow my jammer until they return to their bench area to maintain continuous visibility of their actions.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Clear, kind, and supportive communication with my SK before, during, and after each game.</li> <li>Awareness of potential NOTT points and understanding when a jammer earns and does not earn those points.</li> <li>Timely and accurate tracking and recall, by player, of earned passes, points, superior position, and positional gain.</li> <li>Confident points reporting precisely as a jam ends (simultaneously with the fourth whistle).</li> <li>Continuous monitoring of the relationship between what I report to my SK and the information on the scoreboard.</li> <li>Awareness of the space I occupy and making my profile as small as possible to keep from obscuring game action from my peers.</li> <li>Understanding of how my position impacts my peer JR and the ability to adapt to their positioning preference to support fluid, dynamic movement with my peer JR.</li> <li>Anticipating situations that may result in a star pass that is difficult to see.</li> <li>Lateral movement that allows me to predominantly face my entire body toward my jammer, giving me the best possible view of my jammer and allowing me to rapidly accelerate and decelerate in any direction at any time.</li> <li>Immediate and precise responsiveness to jammer call-off requests.</li> <li>Thorough understanding of SK responsibilities and communication needs.</li> <li>Ability to support developing SKs with feedback that helps them comfortably learn and build confidence in the SK role.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>When I believe my jammer is incorrectly penalized by another official, I can sometimes lose focus while attempting to rationalize the situation.  This can result in me:<ul> <li>Losing track of which passes/points (if any) are earned and which are still available to earn.</li> <li>Indecisiveness about whether the specific game circumstances warrant me allowing my jammer to immediately serve a penalty I do not agree with or immediately returning the jammer to the track.<ul> <li>In either case, I would discuss the penalty with the issuing official after the current jam.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Although I am comfortable adapting my positioning to my peer JR's specific style and needs, I will sometimes forget to implement those adaptations consistently.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Before each jam, I identify my jammer and align myself with their position, ensuring I can observe their actions before and after the jam starting whistle.</li> <li>Precise alignment with my jammer throughout the duration of each jam in a way that allows me to continuously and accurately observe my jammer's position relative to other players.</li> <li>Frequent use of wheel-stopping techniques (hockey stops, power slides, etc.) to keep precise alignment with my jammer as they dynamically move within the pack and throughout the track.</li> </ul> IPR My Strengths My Areas for Growth My Positioning Methodology  <ul> <li>Comfort and confidence working from the front and rear IPR positions, depending on my HR/CHR's position preference.</li> <li>Ability to define and track pack location plus adapt to the pack definition metrics of my peer IPR.</li> <li>Ability to adapt to the pack reformation penalty metrics of my peer IPR such that reformation penalty distribution is fair and consistent.</li> <li>Ability to monitor the precise location of skaters so I can accurately report pack conditions and movement.</li> <li>Awareness of situations that may result in unexpected no-pack split scenarios:<ul> <li>Players returning from the penalty box.</li> <li>Players recycling themselves behind all pack skaters and returning to an in-bounds, in-play position.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Clear and loud verbal and visual cues that allow players to quickly understand and respond to warnings before they might receive penalties.</li> <li>Ability to rapidly and dynamically change my positioning and focus as game conditions and pack activities dictate.</li> <li>Capacity to relay information between officials, including relaying penalties from OPRs and JRs to PLTs.</li> <li>Capacity to relay to JRs which players are OOP, NOTT, etc., and reporting that information to JRs proactively.</li> <li>Ongoing communication with other officials about pack location and player positioning relative to the pack, specifically communicating to JRs the location of jammers relative to the pack and engagement zone(s).</li> <li>Awareness of where players re-enter the track relative to the front engagement zone.</li> <li>Ability to \"chase down\" and issue an OOP warning to a player who leaves the front engagement zone while believing they are a jammer after they unsuccessfully take a star pass.</li> <li>Ability to rapidly accelerate while skating backward and skate backward at high speed without the need to look at the track boundary to ensure I remain off the gameplay area.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>My pack definition is sometimes too \"academic\" for practical gameplay, which results in me issuing more verbal cues/warnings than necessary.<ul> <li>For example, I have the tendency to issue a \"no-pack\" warning when I believe the distance between players who are maintaining pack connectivity exceeds ten feet.</li> <li>However, in many of these cases, immediate pack reformation is imminent, and gameplay would benefit from me reducing unnecessary verbal cues.</li> </ul> </li> <li>During gameplay with rapid, dynamic pack movement, I tend to over-focus on pack definition and engagement zone tracking which can cause me to not be as mindful as necessary of contact-based penalties.</li> <li>Specifically as a front IPR, when I am working with a rear IPR that I do not work with regularly, I can be slow to adapt to their assessment of distances between players.<ul> <li>This can result in me issuing \"no-pack\" warnings when the rear IPR still has definition of an established pack.</li> <li>I am actively focused on my early-game attentiveness and adaptation to the way my rear IPR peer performs their pack definition.</li> </ul> </li> <li>I am continuously working to improve my pack identification accuracy.

Breadpool is extremely strong on JR rules including star passes, lead eligibility, and points (Breadpool can always answer which skater's points were and were not earned), and he understands initiator, illegal actions, and impact well. As an OPR, Breadpool understands and issued penalties on trickier rules such as illegal assists and illegal contact for gaining speed out of bounds. His impact spectrum meshes well with that of other high-level refs I've worked with--he can defend calls and non-calls, and he does not overcall. Our crew was chosen to officiate the sanctioned Open Division final, and Breadpool was chosen to JR because he was one of the strongest JRs on the crew. Breadpool has the skating skills to manage JRing and OPRing a top-level, fast-paced open-gender game. The skaters were very knowledgable (sic) and vocal, and there was a degree of pressure associated with the game, but Breadpool performed very well.</p> <p>One moment of note was an official review requesting a call on Breadpool's jammer, when he did not quite have the angle to support a call. However, both PLTs saw the action and recommended a penalty. Breadpool was happy to have their perspective and issue the penalty on their recommendation, and went out of his way to thank them and give kudos for their support. Bread does not let ego restrict him in OR huddles and he values the input of off-skates officials. Bread is similarly kind, complimentary, and accessible to scorekeepers, and cross-trains as an SK and SBO to understand their perspective and challenges. Bread's experience in multiple officiating positions, on and off skates, give him a great understanding of game mechanics that is valuable on a crew.</p> <p>As the tournament progressed, our crew made a couple adjustments (for example, we slightly relaxed our insub metric to flex toward the other crews for consistency; we discussed and tweaked impact spectrum for blocking out of bounds). Breadpool adjusted well to the tournament-specific metrics. Breadpool is especially valuable as a communicator. He works hard to develop and implement clear \"no call\" informational signals such as initiator indications, \"one hand went out,\" \"contact to side,\" and others. He has very good instincts for passing on information to the HR about contact he's observing or escalation trajectories that will be helpful for speaking to the coaches so the HR can quickly address team concerns.</p> <p>Bread's penalty signals are clear and deliberate, and (speaking as a person who PLTs) he understands the importance of communicating his calls to the middle. Bread is also great at communicating with teams, coaches, and skaters: he is always appropriate and professional, and he treats teams and coaches as partners in facilitating great events.</p> <p>And here is the broader feedback:</p> <p>Breadpool didn't have any areas of improvement that were detriment to a game.

Breadpool worked one game as JR and the other for (sic) as OPR.</p> <p>Overall, Breadpool's skating skills are excellent.  He can maintain good position the majority of the time.  As front OPR when the pack would move to sprinting speed it was rare that he would lose position.  That said, there two times when he tried to do a powerslide to stop at the end of a sprint and almost slid off the track and into the stands. I did not mention it to him but kept an eye on it.  After the second time, he seemed to adjust his skating style and it did not happen again.  As the crew head/HR, several of our games required an intense amount of focus, so having an official who can self-correct is excellent.</p> <p>As JR Breadpool again has good skating skills.  He was very supportive of his fellow JR and worked well with the crew overall.  His points were correct and his impact spectrum is good.</p> <p>As an official Breadpool is very professional and easy to work with.  When asked a question during a timeout his responses are succinct and well thought out.</p> <p>The only minor piece of feedback that I have for Breadpool is that at times his seriousness on the track can make him seem a little unapproachable. He has an intense focus and a great respect for the role of officiating as a whole, which I appreciate. It seems to me that he forgets to switch off that intensity when interacting with other officials or skaters. This is an extremely minor thing and very nit-picky - as a whole I am always happy to work with Breadpool and am extremely thankful that he was on my crew.</p> <p>And here is the broader feedback:</p> <p>As a short-statured official, I greatly appreciate Breadpool's ability as a JR to do extremely low powerslides when coming into the pack while following their jammer.

I was the THNSO, but also worked in-game positions. On the NSO side, Breadpool worked as SBO (3 games) and PBT (1 game).</p> <p>I worked directly with Breadpool in the penalty box as PBT. His timing and paperwork were accurate even under the pressure of players cycling through the penalty box in high volume. He maintained consistent and clear communication with his paired PLT throughout the game, going to confirm penalties with every timeout. The venue was loud, but I could hear his instructions to the players the majority of the time; however, there were a few times that he could have been a little louder or clearer as the players did not always immediately recognise (sic) that they were good to return to the track. He also maintained communication with our PBM regarding number of penalties and jammer penalties. He kept a calm demeanour (sic) throughout the game and did not appear to be rushed.</p> <p>I got to experience Breadpool SBO from multiple perspectives over the weekend as THNSO, CHNSO, and PLT. Two of the games went very smoothly - jams started and ended in sync with the JT, points and lead status were awarded promptly, and communication between Breadpool and the SKs was clear and observable from all around the venue. I noticed Breadpool watching the JT and JRs for points and call offs. But the third game, Philly v FoCo, which was very high-intensity and high-volume being the same teams that played during the open division gold medal game at 2024 JRDA Championships, had some computer trouble. During the game, certain hotkeys were not responding, and even though Breadpool was clicking the button to end timeout, the scoreboard did not go into post-timeout. This issue occurred a few times, resulting in clock stoppages, but that was limited to the first half of the game as Breadpool became more conscious of the issue and worked around it accordingly.</p> <p>Additionally, during one of the jams in the first half, the scoreboard froze and stopped accepting input. Breadpool was able to promptly get my attention (I was CHNSO/PLT) and called for us to call off the jam. While there was initially some confusion as to whether the jam should have been called off or if the clock would have run off of the JT's clock, we determined that Breadpool made the right call in telling us to go into an OTO.</p> <p>After the Philly v FoCo game, Breadpool went to speak to the coaches out of his own volition to explain the situation that occurred with the scoreboard freezing. He was very collected and was taking accountability for requesting that the jam be called. I did not hear much of the conversation, but the Philly coach did talk to me afterwards saying how appreciative she was to hear the situation directly from him and that she respected him for taking accountability and seeking her out. It definitely calmed down a lot of nerves from a high intensity and high volume game, especially as Philly had been frustrated with the OTOs for the scoreboard.</p> <p>Cordially, Officials Certification</p>"},{"location":"evaluations.html#evaluation-11-sbo","title":"Evaluation #11 - SBO","text":"Summer Slam 2025 - 16-17 August, 2025  Overview Evaluation Broader Feedback  <p>[this is an automated email]</p> <p>Dear Breadpool (He/Him; Rose City Rollers),</p> <p>This is an automated email from Certification, designed to let you know that REDACTED (as a(n) Crew Head Official) filled out an eval for Summer Slam, an event from 8/16/2025 to 8/17/2025, involving 3 sanctioned games, 1 regulation games for WFTDA, during which you served as SBO.</p> <p>Here is the evaluation:</p> <p>Full Disclosure: Breadpool and I share the same home league, and work together fairly often. However, crew staffing and positions for this sanctioned tournament were decided by the tournament heads.</p> <p>Breadpool worked four games as SBO for Summer Slam. He was partnered with one highly experienced official and one newer scorekeeper. The tournament got off to a rocky technical start as CRG was experiencing issues before the start of our first game. As a result, all of the games that had previously been loaded into CRG were not loading. Breadpool jumped in and assisted by entering game and roster data. This allowed me to finish updating paperwork, setup, etc.</p> <p>During a longer gap between games, Breadpool was able to figure out that the issues we were having had to do with CRG not recognizing the correct time for games. CRG was showing UTC, and we were PST. He was able to work around the issue and get things back on track.</p> <p>During gameplay, Breadpool partnered well with the jam timer. The nonverbal communication was consistent, and to my knowledge, there were no clock adjustments needed. I was able to observe several jam starts, and the timing of the starts was consistent with the whistle. Timeouts were quickly and accurately noted with no corrections needed.</p> <p>In addition to the time issue with CRG, the weekend had a few more hiccups. At one point, the cable between the monitor and the scoreboard disconnected. This was noticed instantly and resolved without any game interruption or delay. Additionally, there were moments where CRG just sorta seized up between jams. On a couple of instances, this occurred,  Breadpool and the jam timer were able to communicate quickly as to whether a time-out would be needed, reducing the instances of clock stoppages.</p> <p>While this was a sanctioned tournament, it is important to note that the score table had an error, resulting in a score offset. In this instance, the jam ref assessed a box point at the end of the jam, not realizing that the skater was a jammer (cover off). This was recognized in the next jam, which was very short. Unfortunately, the information was not relayed to the score table in enough time to resolve the discrepancy before the jam ended. Breadpool recognized the issue and brought it to my attention as quickly as possible, while following proper procedures.</p> <p>Despite all technical difficulties and just odd situations throughout the weekend, Breadpool was calm, helpful, friendly, and professional throughout the weekend. He took the time to listen to his scorekeeper, who has well over a decade of scoreboard experience, and mentored the newer official whose favorite position is SBO.</p> <p>While I did not have a say in positional staffing this tournament, I was relieved to see Breadpool as my SBO. I am happy to staff him in that position at any level of derby.</p> <p>None.</p> <p>Cordially, Officials Certification</p>"},{"location":"evaluations.html#evaluation-12-opr-ipr","title":"Evaluation #12 - OPR, IPR","text":"Cactus Cup 2025 - 18-20 April, 2025  Overview Evaluation Broader Feedback  <p>[this is an automated email]</p> <p>Dear Breadpool (He/Him; Rose City Rollers),</p> <p>This is an automated email from Certification, designed to let you know that REDACTED (as a(n) co-CHR; I CHR'd 2 games and I OPR'd 3 games) filled out an eval for Cactus Cup 2025, an event from 4/18/2025 to 4/20/2025, involving 3 sanctioned games, 2 regulation games for WFTDA, during which you served as IPR, OPR.</p> <p>Here is the evaluation:</p> <p>Breadpool (Bread) was an official on our crew at Cactus Cup 2025. I was a co-CHR alongside REDACTED. I am writing this evaluation using notes taken at the time of the tournament and notes taken from watching online footage of the tournament. Bread officiated three games at IPR and two games at OPR</p> <p>Bread\u2019s demeanor throughout the tournament was genial and collaborative. His communication across the weekend was concise and to-the-point. During ORs, he would only convey relevant information. He was very open to feedback across the weekend.</p> <p>For his games at OPR, Bread was in the FOPR position. Bread received feedback from the THR that his acceleration up front was a bit off, leading Bread to disclose that he had hip surgery 6 weeks ago. I was shocked, even though I agreed with the feedback, it appeared to be a relatively minor issue. Regardless, I believe this is a temporary issue. At FOPR, he demonstrated good end-of-Jam position and was able to assist JRs for points questions on multiple occasions. His contact penalty metric appeared to be consistent with the rest of the crew. For instance, Bread had an excellent Blocking a Down Skater Illegal Contact penalty where a Jammer didn\u2019t take sufficient action to avoid a down skater. Overall, his OPR performance was solid while noting his acceleration wasn\u2019t up to his own standard.</p> <p>At FIPR, Bread really shined in this tournament. He and REDACTED came to a set of consensus \u201cFailure to\u201d very quickly. Bread and REDACTED were in sync both on declaring No Packs and redefining the Pack. Bread\u2019s 20 ft was consistent across the weekend, as was his identification of OOP Blocks in the front. It was a real joy to watch the two of them handle the Pack together.</p> <p>A very small nit to pick is that on several occasions, Bread issued a Low Block and his hand signal was not as clear as it could be. This is more for informational purposes than critical feedback, but Bread makes the signal with his arm a few inches away from his chest instead of on his chest, which makes for a confusing sign when repeated.</p> <p>Overall, Bread had a strong tournament on a strong crew. I look forward to working with Bread again soon.</p> <p>Additional thoughts from REDACTED: I\u2019ve worked on crews with Bread several times and I\u2019m always very impressed with his level of interaction and adaptation with the crew and the event. Bread did a great job at Cactus Cup, and understanding that he can \u201cflex\u201d toward a crew or standard depending on the expectations makes his work exceptional. He is quick to discuss what he\u2019s seeing and to adapt to impact thresholds (for example, when does knocking an opponent into a downed skater warrant a misconduct?) to match the crew or direction from the THRs. Being adaptable is an excellent skill for a tournament-level official.</p> <p>Bread has no ego attached to his calls and will readily discuss or overturn calls based on another official\u2019s perspective. He expects the same of other officials, which is a skill I admire: he\u2019s not sheepish about offering a differing perspective on a crewmate\u2019s call. Sometimes I think it\u2019s harder to voice a differing opinion than it is to hear one (especially to a crew head), and I really appreciate having a crewmate who will speak up. He does all this quickly and efficiently, and rarely needs an OTO to discuss. I believe this level of thoughtful neutrality helped our crew get the right calls to support the skaters. Bread is a dreammate.</p> <p>None.</p> <p>Cordially, Officials Certification</p> <p> JT, Crow City Derby vs. Trans Rollers United, March, 2025         Credit: Divo

destruction (legally or illegally) while concurrently issuing a \"no-pack\" warning.</li> <li>I determined that Blue #555 illegally destroyed the pack, and I made a mental note to not include them in the process of redefining the pack.</li> <li>I quickly look to my right and left to account for all blockers, observe blocker movement, determine if blockers are taking the appropriate actions to reform the pack, and continue monitoring the distance between blockers from both teams.</li> <li>I issue a second \"no-pack\" warning, check the distance between blockers from both teams (excluding Blue #555, who I know to be a penalized player), and issue the verbal cue \"pack is here\" as the pack reforms.</li> <li>I immediately assess the pack destruction penalty to Blue #555 just as the jam ends.</li> </ul> </li> <li>I practice extensively to have the capacity to manage these sorts of situations with speed and precision.  Specifically, and that includes:<ul> <li>Practicing pack definition for several hours each week with varying levels of skill and competitiveness.</li> <li>I obsessively study game video of my own pack definition and that of other officials to learn how I can improve.</li> <li>I augment my game video study by mocking up various in-game pack scenarios with Track-Viz  to help me better visualize pack geometry and improve the speed and precision at which I can monitor and process pack dynamics.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> https://youtu.be/dVJcbkzW78w?t=5096  </p> Overview Outcome Importance  <ul> <li>At the \u22481:25:38 mark in this video, while serving as front IPR, a sustained no-pack situation occurs.</li> <li>Players from both teams do not immediately take appropriate actions to reform the pack, and several players commit actions that have sufficient impact to warrant penalties.</li> <li>It is not clear to the JRs whether Lead Jammer status is available or lost.</li> <li>It is my responsibility to:<ul> <li>Issue \"no-pack\" warnings until the pack reforms.</li> <li>Identify and track any players who commit penalties within my coverage zone (the front wall, in this case).</li> <li>Use clear verbal and visual cues to indicate when the pack reforms.</li> <li>Clearly communicate penalty assessment to my on- and off-skates peer officials so they have the information they need to do their jobs.</li> <li>Ensure the JRs understand the availability of Lead Jammer status.</li> <li>Remain in position to continue observing game action.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Before the pack reforms, I determine that:<ul> <li>Blue Jammer (#277) initiates OOP contact with Green #616, which causes Green #616 to adopt a downed position.</li> <li>Green #03 is the blocker most responsible for reforming the pack and fails to take the required action(s) to do so.</li> </ul> </li> <li>When the pack reforms, I issue the verbal cue \"pack is here\" and immediately start the process to assess the appropriate penalties.<ul> <li>The JR for Blue doesn't have a way of knowing that I intend to assess a penalty to Blue Jammer, and they begin to use the whistle signal and visual cue to issue Lead Jammer status.</li> <li>I am already moving into position to issue an illegal contact penalty to Blue Jammer (for an OOP block with game impact) to help reduce confusion about Lead Jammer status availability.</li> <li>As soon as I issue the penalty to Blue Jammer, I make a rapid direction change to return to my position and immediately issue an illegal position penalty to Green #03 for failure to reform the pack.</li> </ul> </li> <li>I observe my peer IPR penalize Blue #21 and I identify that there are only three blockers on the track.<ul> <li>I determine that the current pack formation does not require the attention of two IPRs, and, while keeping my body facing the pack, I skate toward the PLTs to ensure they have all of the information they need to track the surge of penalties.</li> </ul> </li> <li>I return to my position at the front of the pack after communicating with the PLTs for \u22485 seconds and observe the Green Jammer establish superior position over all blockers, although the JR does not immediately indicate Lead Jammer status.<ul> <li>The JR for Green turns their head toward me to ask if Lead Jammer status is open.</li> <li>I reach my right hand to my left hand to feel for an assistive device that I habitually use to track Lead Jammer availability.</li> <li>I feel the position of the assistive device and determine that Lead Jammer status is open, so I turn my head toward the JR for Green and say, \"Open, open, open.\"</li> <li>The Green JR immediately issues Lead Jammer status.        </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>I believe the front IPR position is more challenging than it may appear to the untrained eye.  In my opinion, a well-practiced IPR excels at:<ul> <li>\"Owning\" their own coverage zone while providing supporting coverage and communication to their peer SOs and NSOs.</li> <li>Rapid task switching between pack definition, contact initiation assessment, player position changes, lead jammer status, etc.</li> <li>Rapid backward acceleration, backward skating at high speed, immediate stops and direction changes, continuously positioning themselves to observe the most relevant game action, and ensuring that JRs have unobstructed lanes.</li> <li>Understanding track geometry through its turns and how it impacts the distance between players and the shape of the engagement zone.</li> </ul> </li> <li>I extensively study and practice the front IPR position to embody these traits so I can manage complex situations like this one while supporting and advising my peer officials.</li> </ul> <p> https://youtu.be/dVJcbkzW78w?t=5132  </p> Overview Outcome Importance  <ul> <li>At the \u22481:28:05 mark in this video, while serving as front IPR, Green #616 attempts to create a bridge between the front and rear blocker walls.</li> <li> <p>A series of events happen nearly simultaneously, which causes Green #616 to illegally destroy the pack:</p> <ol> <li> <p>All on-track blockers are part of an established pack with clearly defined front and rear walls as Green #616 leaves the penalty box, legally enters the track, and skates in derby direction until they reach the front wall.</p> <ul> <li>This action and natural gameplay move the pack from \"all\" to \"front.\"</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>At the rear wall, Blue #21 initiates a block that sends the Green Jammer OOB and skates in non-derby direction to recycle the Green Jammer.</p> <ul> <li>Blue #21 skates more than 10 feet from the nearest blocker.</li> <li>Blue #21 continues skating in non-derby direction until they reach the edge of the rear engagement zone and receive an OOP warning from the rear IPR.</li> <li>Blue #21 responds to the OOP warning by skating in derby direction and returning to the rear engagement zone.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>At the front wall, Green #616 comes to a stop and begins skating in non-derby direction as Blue #21 returns to a position within 10 feet of the rear wall.</p> <ul> <li>The rear wall is still within the rear engagement zone and not part of the pack.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Green #616 continues skating in non-derby direction until they are more than 10 feet from the front wall's rearmost blocker and within 10 feet of the foremost blocker in the rear wall.</p> <ul> <li>This action created two equally sized groups of blockers from both teams that were more than 10 feet apart, commonly referred to as a \"no-pack, split.\"</li> </ul> </li> </ol> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Green #616 illegally destroyed the pack.</li> <li>Even though I've yet to issue a penalty to Green #616, as a penalized skater, they are no longer part of pack definition, so the pack immediately reforms at the front wall.</li> <li>I use the following verbal and visual cues sequentially and without delay:<ul> <li>\"No-pack, split.\"</li> <li>\"Pack is here.\"</li> <li>1 x long whistle blast.</li> <li>\"Green #616, destruction.\"</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Getting this right and in sync with the rear IPR takes a lot of practice and requires that I concurrently and precisely:<ul> <li>Measure the distance between the rearmost pack skater and Green #616.</li> <li>Monitor Green #616's proximity to the foremost blocker in the rear wall.</li> <li>Monitor Blue #21\u2019s proximity to the rearmost blocker in the rear wall as Blue #21 returns to the rear engagement zone.</li> <li>Identify whether Green #616 is skating in non-derby direction, stopped, or skating in derby direction at the exact moment the no-pack split occurs.</li> <li>Align my measurements and timing with the rear IPR.</li> <li>Identify and signal the pack\u2019s destruction and immediate reformation with the appropriate verbal and visual cues.</li> <li>Penalize Green #616 for illegally destroying the pack.</li> </ul> </li> <li>As my peers evaluate me, I want them to see that:<ul> <li>I am capable of correctly processing and handling complex pack dynamics in real-time, and they can trust me to support them similarly when they include me on their officiating rosters.</li> <li>I can identify and penalize blockers who illegally destroy the pack so my peer IPR/HR can focus on other game action.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> https://youtu.be/dVJcbkzW78w?t=5276  </p>"},{"location":"officiating_history.html","title":"WFTDA Officiating History Information","text":""},{"location":"officiating_history.html#direct-ohd-access","title":"Direct OHD Access","text":"<p>You may directly access my WFTDA OHD at https://bit.ly/breadpool-history , and an embedded version of my OHD is available below.</p>"},{"location":"officiating_history.html#embedded-ohd-preview","title":"Embedded OHD Preview","text":""}]}
